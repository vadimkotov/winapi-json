This function will not return a common-store file that was not also returned in a call to  SisCSFilesToBackupForLink during the backup operation, assuming that the SIS reparse data stored on the media has not been corrupted. When restoring a SIS link, your restore operation should create only the appropriate sparse file, initialize any allocated ranges, and then write the SIS reparse data exactly as it was read during the backup operation. It is crucial that your restore operation create sparse files with unallocated ranges rather than sparse files (or nonsparse files) initialized with zeroes. Note that this function will not necessarily identify the common-store file or files corresponding to a set of SIS links on the backup media if those common-store file or files still exist on disk. The contents of a common-store file's data stream never changes once it is created, so if the file already exists on the disk there is no need to restore it.
