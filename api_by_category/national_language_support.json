Both CompareString and CompareStringEx ignore Arabic kashidas during the comparison. Thus, if two strings are identical except for the presence of kashidas, the function returns CSTR_EQUAL. When the application uses the NORM_IGNORENONSPACE and NORM_IGNORECASE flags with the sorting function, the flags can sometimes interfere with string comparisons. This situation might result for a locale that does not support non-spacing characters or case, but uses equivalent weight levels to handle other important operations. In such cases, your application should use the LINGUISTIC_IGNOREDIACRITIC and LINGUISTIC_IGNORECASE flags. These flags provide linguistically appropriate results for sorting code points that use case and diacritic marks, and have no impact on other code points. Beginning in Windows Vista:  Both CompareString and CompareStringEx can retrieve data from custom locales. Data is not guaranteed to be the same from computer to computer or between runs of an application. If your application must persist or transmit data, see Using Persistent Locale Data. Beginning in Windows 8: If your app passes language tags to this function from the Windows.Globalization namespace, it must first convert the tags by calling ResolveLocaleName. Beginning in Windows 8: CompareStringEx  is declared in Stringapiset.h. Before Windows 8, it was declared in Winnls.h.

This parameter can specify a combination of any of the following values, or it can be set to 0 to obtain the default behavior.  FlagMeaning  LINGUISTIC_IGNORECASE   Ignore case, as linguistically appropriate.   LINGUISTIC_IGNOREDIACRITIC   Ignore nonspacing characters, as linguistically appropriate. Note  This flag does not always produce predictable results when used with decomposed characters, that is, characters in which a base character and one or more nonspacing characters each have distinct code point values.     NORM_IGNORECASE   Ignore case. For many scripts (notably Latin scripts), NORM_IGNORECASE coincides with LINGUISTIC_IGNORECASE. Note  NORM_IGNORECASE ignores any tertiary distinction, whether it is actually linguistic case or not. For example, in Arabic and Indic scripts, this distinguishes alternate forms of a character, but the differences do not correspond to linguistic case. LINGUISTIC_IGNORECASE causes the function to ignore only actual linguistic casing, instead of ignoring the third sorting weight.   Note  With this flag set, the function ignores the distinction between the wide and narrow forms of the CJK compatibility characters.     NORM_IGNOREKANATYPE   Do not differentiate between hiragana and katakana characters. Corresponding hiragana and katakana characters compare as equal.   NORM_IGNORENONSPACE   Ignore nonspacing characters. For many scripts (notably Latin scripts), NORM_IGNORENONSPACE coincides with LINGUISTIC_IGNOREDIACRITIC. Note  NORM_IGNORENONSPACE ignores any secondary distinction, whether it is a diacritic or not. Scripts for Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and Indic languages, among others, use this distinction for purposes other than diacritics. LINGUISTIC_IGNOREDIACRITIC causes the function to ignore only actual diacritics, instead of ignoring the second sorting weight.   Note  NORM_IGNORENONSPACE only has an effect for locales in which accented characters are sorted in a second pass from main characters. Normally all characters in the string are first compared without regard to accents and, if the strings are equal, a second pass over the strings is performed to compare accents. This flag causes the second pass to not be performed. For locales that sort accented characters in the first pass, this flag has no effect.     NORM_IGNORESYMBOLS   Ignore symbols and punctuation.   NORM_IGNOREWIDTH   Ignore the difference between half-width and full-width characters, for example, C a t == cat. The full-width form is a formatting distinction used in Chinese and Japanese scripts.   NORM_LINGUISTIC_CASING   Use linguistic rules for casing, instead of file system rules (default).   SORT_DIGITSASNUMBERS   Windows 7: Treat digits as numbers during sorting, for example, sort \"2\" before \"10\".   SORT_STRINGSORT   Treat punctuation the same as symbols."

By default, this function maps the lowercase \"i\" to the uppercase \"I\", even when the Locale parameter specifies Turkish (Turkey) or Azerbaijani (Azerbaijan). To override this behavior for Turkish or Azerbaijani, the application should specify NORM_LINGUISTIC_CASING. If this flag is specified for the correct locale, \"\u00c4\u00b1\" (lowercase dotless I) is the lowercase form of \"I\" (uppercase dotless I) and \"i\" (lowercase dotted I) is the lowercase form of \"\u00c4\u00b1\" (uppercase dotted I).

On success, it returns a 0-based index. Use of this index helps the function avoid off-by-one errors and one-character buffer overruns. This function is one of the few NLS functions that calls SetLastError even when it succeeds. It makes this call to clear the last error in a thread when it fails to match the search string.

The application should enclose any text that should remain in its exact form in the date string within single quotation marks in the date format picture. The single quotation mark can also be used as an escape character to allow the single quotation mark itself to be displayed in the date string. However, the escape sequence must be enclosed within two single quotation marks. For example, to display the date as \"May '93\", the format string is: L\"MMMM ''''yy\". The first and last single quotation marks are the enclosing quotation marks. The second and third single quotation marks are the escape sequence to allow the single quotation mark to be displayed before the century. When the date picture contains both a numeric form of the day (either d or dd) and the full month name (MMMM), the genitive form of the month name is retrieved in the date string. To obtain the default short and long date format without performing any actual formatting, the application should use GetLocaleInfoEx with the LOCALE_SSHORTDATE or LOCALE_SLONGDATE constant. To get the date format for an alternate calendar, the application uses GetLocaleInfoEx with the LOCALE_IOPTIONALCALENDAR constant. To get the date format for a particular calendar, the application uses GetCalendarInfoEx, passing the appropriate Calendar Identifier. It can call EnumCalendarInfoEx or EnumDateFormatsEx to retrieve date formats for a particular calendar. This function can retrieve data from custom locales. Data is not guaranteed to be the same from computer to computer or between runs of an application. If your application must persist or transmit data, see Using Persistent Locale Data. The DATE_LONGDATE format includes two kinds of date patterns: patterns that include the day of the week and patterns that do not include the day of the week. For example, \"Tuesday, October 18, 2016\" or \"October 18, 2016\".  If your application needs to ensure that dates use one of these kinds of patterns and not the other kind, your application should perform the following actions: If the presence or absence of the day of the week in the long date format does not matter to your application, your application can call GetDateFormatEx directly without first enumerating all of the long date formats by calling EnumDateFormatsExEx. Beginning in Windows 8: If your app passes language tags to this function from the Windows.Globalization namespace, it must first convert the tags by calling ResolveLocaleName. Beginning in Windows 8: GetDateFormatEx  is declared in Datetimeapi.h. Before Windows 8, it was declared in Winnls.h. ",

Thus the words in the output buffer correspond not to the original ANSI string but to its Unicode equivalent.

Therefore, the correspondence between the words in the output buffer and the characters in the original ANSI string is not one-to-one in all cases, for example, multibyte strings. Thus GetStringTypeA is of limited use for multi-character strings. GetStringTypeW and GetStringTypeEx are recommended instead.

For example, Greek letters are specified as C1_ALPHA for any value of Locale. The Locale parameter is not used by the corresponding GetStringTypeW function. Because of the parameter difference, an application cannot automatically invoke the proper ANSI or Unicode version of a GetStringType* function through the use of the #define UNICODE switch.

    "remarks": "For an overview of the use of the string functions, see Strings. Using the ANSI code page for the supplied locale, this function translates the source string from ANSI to Unicode. It then analyzes each Unicode character for character type information. The ANSI version of this function converts the source string to Unicode and calls the  corresponding GetStringTypeW function. Thus the words in the output buffer correspond not to the original ANSI string but to its Unicode equivalent. The conversion from ANSI to Unicode can result in a change in string length, for example, a pair of ANSI characters can map to a single  Unicode character. Therefore, the correspondence between the words in the output buffer and the characters in the original ANSI string is not one-to-one in all cases, for example, multibyte strings. Thus, the ANSI version of this function is of limited use for multi-character strings. The Unicode version of the function is recommended instead. This function circumvents a limitation caused by the difference in parameters between GetStringTypeA and GetStringTypeW. Because of the parameter difference, an application cannot automatically invoke the proper ANSI or Unicode version of a GetStringType* function through the use of the #define UNICODE switch. On the other hand, GetStringTypeEx, behaves properly with regard to that switch. Thus it is the recommended function. When the ANSI version of this function is used with a Unicode-only locale identifier, the function can succeed because the operating system uses the system code page. However, characters that are undefined in the system code page appear in the string as a question mark (?). The values of the lpSrcStr and lpCharType parameters must not be the same. If they are the same, the function fails with ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER. The Locale parameter is only used to perform string conversion to Unicode. It has nothing to do with the CTYPE* values supplied by the application. These values are solely determined by Unicode code points, and do not vary on a locale basis. For example, Greek letters are specified as C1_ALPHA for any value of Locale. ",

This flag allows the function to process characters that are not currently legal in IDNs, but might be legal in later versions of the IDNA standard. If your application encodes unassigned code points as Punycode, the resulting domain names should be illegal.

LCMAP_FULLWIDTH   Use Unicode (wide) characters where applicable. This flag and LCMAP_HALFWIDTH are mutually exclusive.   LCMAP_HALFWIDTH   Use narrow characters where applicable. This flag and LCMAP_FULLWIDTH are mutually exclusive.   LCMAP_HIRAGANA   Map all katakana characters to hiragana. This flag and LCMAP_KATAKANA are mutually exclusive.   LCMAP_KATAKANA   Map all hiragana characters to katakana. This flag and LCMAP_HIRAGANA are mutually exclusive.   LCMAP_LINGUISTIC_CASING                    Use linguistic rules for casing, instead of file system rules (default). This flag is valid with LCMAP_LOWERCASE or LCMAP_UPPERCASE only.   LCMAP_LOWERCASE   For locales and scripts capable of handling uppercase and lowercase, map all characters to lowercase.   LCMAP_SIMPLIFIED_CHINESE   Map traditional Chinese characters to simplified Chinese characters. This flag and LCMAP_TRADITIONAL_CHINESE are mutually exclusive.   LCMAP_SORTKEY   Produce a normalized sort key. If the LCMAP_SORTKEY flag is not specified, the function performs string mapping. For details of sort key generation and string mapping, see the Remarks section.   LCMAP_TITLECASE   Windows 7: Map all characters to title case, in which the first letter of each major word is capitalized.   LCMAP_TRADITIONAL_CHINESE   Map simplified Chinese characters to traditional Chinese characters. This flag and LCMAP_SIMPLIFIED_CHINESE are mutually exclusive.   LCMAP_UPPERCASE   For locales and scripts capable of handling uppercase and lowercase, map all characters to uppercase.     The following flags can be used alone, with one another, or with the LCMAP_SORTKEY and/or LCMAP_BYTEREV flags. However, they cannot be combined with the other flags listed above.  FlagMeaning  NORM_IGNORENONSPACE   Ignore nonspacing characters. For many scripts (notably Latin scripts), NORM_IGNORENONSPACE coincides with LINGUISTIC_IGNOREDIACRITIC. Note  NORM_IGNORENONSPACE ignores any secondary distinction, whether it is a diacritic or not. Scripts for Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and Indic languages, among others, use this distinction for purposes other than diacritics. LINGUISTIC_IGNOREDIACRITIC causes the function to ignore only actual diacritics, instead of ignoring the second sorting weight.     NORM_IGNORESYMBOLS   Ignore symbols and punctuation.     The flags listed below are used only with the LCMAP_SORTKEY flag.  FlagMeaning  LINGUISTIC_IGNORECASE   Ignore case, as linguistically appropriate.   LINGUISTIC_IGNOREDIACRITIC   Ignore nonspacing characters, as linguistically appropriate. Note  This flag does not always produce predictable results when used with decomposed characters, that is, characters in which a base character and one or more nonspacing characters each have distinct code point values.     NORM_IGNORECASE   Ignore case. For many scripts (notably Latin scripts), NORM_IGNORECASE coincides with LINGUISTIC_IGNORECASE. Note  NORM_IGNORECASE ignores any tertiary distinction, whether it is actually linguistic case or not. For example, in Arabic and Indic scripts, this flag distinguishes alternate forms of a character, but the differences do not correspond to linguistic case. LINGUISTIC_IGNORECASE causes the function to ignore only actual linguistic casing, instead of ignoring the third sorting weight.   Note  For double-byte character set (DBCS) locales, NORM_IGNORECASE has an effect on all Unicode characters as well as narrow (one-byte) characters, including Greek and Cyrillic characters.     NORM_IGNOREKANATYPE   Do not differentiate between hiragana and katakana characters. Corresponding hiragana and katakana characters compare as equal.   NORM_IGNOREWIDTH   Ignore the difference between half-width and full-width characters, for example, C a t == cat. The full-width form is a formatting distinction used in Chinese and Japanese scripts.   NORM_LINGUISTIC_CASING   Use linguistic rules for casing, instead of file system rules (default).

The function still returns TRUE if the locale list contains more scripts than the test list, but all the test list scripts must be contained in the locale list. If VS_ALLOW_LATIN is specified in dwFlags, the function behaves as if \"Latn;\" is always in the locale list. In all other cases, the function returns FALSE. This return can indicate that the test list contains an item that is not in the locale list, or it can indicate an error. To distinguish between these two cases, the application should call GetLastError, which can return one of the following error codes: ",
    "remarks": "This function compares strings, such as \"Latn;Cyrl;\", that consist of a series of 4-character script names, with each script name followed by a semicolon. It also has a special case to account for the fact that the Latin script is often used in languages and locales for which it is not native. This function is useful as part of a strategy to mitigate security issues related to internationalized domain names (IDNs). The following are examples of the return of this function and a subsequent call to GetLastError in various scenarios. The last two examples illustrate, respectively, a case in which the test list lacks a terminating semicolon (malformed string) and a case in which the test list is empty.  * Results are the same whether VS_ALLOW_LATIN is passed in the dwFlags parameter or no flags are supplied. NLS: Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) Mitigation Sample demonstrates the use of this function. ",
