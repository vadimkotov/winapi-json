Typically, this  function initializes the data structures that it returns to the consumer. In particular, it retrieves index values for its performance objects and counters from the registry and stores these indexes in the appropriate members of the  PERF_OBJECT_TYPE and  PERF_COUNTER_DEFINITION structures. To get the counter and help index values for your objects and counters, query the First Counter and First Help registry values under your application's Performance key located at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\application-name. The first counter index value maps directly to the first symbolic constant value in your symbolic constant header file. (The symbolic constant header file is the header file that you used to load your counters on the computer. For details, see Adding Counter Names and Descriptions to the Registry.) The order of the constants should match the order of the objects and counters that you return in the performance data. If you are managing devices, the pContext parameter should contain the names of the devices that you manage. The OpenPerformanceData function should call the  CreateFile function to open a handle to each device. If CreateFile fails, the OpenPerformanceData function should return the error code returned by the  GetLastError function; otherwise, it should return ERROR_SUCCESS. If the consumer is running on another computer (remotely), then the extensible counter functions are called in the context of the Winlogon process, which handles the server side of the remote connection.
