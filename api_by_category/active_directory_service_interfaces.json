This results in the string containing a mixture of encoded and unencoded characters. For example, if the binary data is 0x05|0x1A|0x1B|0x43|0x32, the encoded string will contain \"\\05\\1A\\1BC2\".

For more information about validating user credentials, see Microsoft Knowledge Base article 180548 HOWTO: Validate User Credentials on Microsoft Operating Systems. A C/C++ client calls the ADsOpenObject helper function to bind to an ADSI object, using the user name and password supplied as credentials for the appropriate directory service. If lpszUsername and lpszPassword are NULL and ADS_SECURE_AUTHENTICATION is set, ADSI binds to the object using the security context of the calling thread, which is either the security context of the user account under which the application is running or of the client user account that the calling thread impersonates. The  credentials passed to the ADsOpenObject function are used only with the particular object bound to and do not affect the security context of the calling thread. This means that, in the example below, the call to ADsOpenObject will use different credentials than the call to ADsGetObject. To work with the WinNT: provider, you can pass in lpszUsername as one of the following strings: With the LDAP provider for Active Directory, you may pass in lpszUsername as one of the following strings: If Kerberos authentication is required for the successful completion of a specific directory request using the LDAP provider, the lpszPathName binding string must use either a serverless ADsPath, such as \"LDAP://CN=Jeff Smith,CN=admin,DC=Fabrikam,DC=com\", or it must use an ADsPath with a fully qualified DNS server name, such as \"LDAP://central3.corp.Fabrikam.com/CN=Jeff Smith,CN=admin,DC=Fabrikam,DC=com\". Binding to the server using a flat NETBIOS name or a short DNS name, for example, using the short name \"central3\" instead of \"central3.corp.Fabrikam.com\", may or may not yield Kerberos authentication.
