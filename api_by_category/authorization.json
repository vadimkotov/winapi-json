The AccessCheckByTypeResultList function compares the specified security descriptor with the specified access token and indicates, in the AccessStatusList parameter, whether access is granted or denied for each of the elements in the object types list. The ObjectTypeList array does not necessarily represent the entire defined object. Rather, it represents that subset of the object for which to check access. For instance, to check access to two properties in a property set, specify an object type list with four elements: the object itself at level zero, the property set at level 1, and the two properties at level 2. The AccessCheckByTypeResultList function evaluates ACEs that apply to the object itself and object-specific ACEs for the object types listed in the ObjectTypeList array. The function ignores object-specific ACEs for object types not listed in the ObjectTypeList array. Thus, the results returned for element zero in the AccessStatusList parameter indicate the access allowed to the subset of the object defined by the ObjectTypeList parameter, not to the entire object. For more information about how a hierarchy of ACEs controls access to an object and its subobjects, see  ACEs to Control Access to an Object's Properties.

    "remarks": "The ConvertToAutoInheritPrivateObjectSecurity function attempts to determine whether the ACEs in the discretionary access control list (DACL) and system access control list (SACL) of the current security descriptor were inherited from the parent security descriptor. The function passes the ParentDescriptor parameter to the  CreatePrivateObjectSecurityEx function to get ACLs that contain only inherited ACEs. Then it compares these ACEs to the ACEs in the original security descriptor to determine which of the original ACEs were inherited. The ACEs do not need to match one-to-one. For instance, an ACE that allows read and write access to a trustee can be equivalent to two ACEs: an ACE that allows read access and an ACE that allows write access. Any ACEs in the original security descriptor that are equivalent to the ACEs inherited from the parent security descriptor are marked with the INHERITED_ACE flag and added to the new security descriptor. All other ACEs in the original security descriptor are added to the new security descriptor as noninherited ACEs. If the original DACL does not have any inherited ACEs, the function sets the SE_DACL_PROTECTED flag in the control bits of the new security descriptor. Similarly, the SE_SACL_PROTECTED flag is set if none of the ACEs in the SACL is inherited. For DACLs that have inherited ACEs, the function reorders the ACEs into two groups. The first group has ACEs that were directly applied to the object. The second group has inherited ACEs. This ordering ensures that noninherited ACEs have precedence over inherited ACEs. For more information, see  Order of ACEs in a DACL. The function sets the SE_DACL_AUTO_INHERITED and SE_SACL_AUTO_INHERITED flags in the control bits of the new security descriptor. The function does not change the ordering of access-allowed ACEs in relation to access-denied ACEs in the DACL because to do so would change the semantics of the resulting security descriptor. If the function cannot convert the DACL without changing the semantics, it leaves the DACL unchanged and sets the SE_DACL_PROTECTED flag. The new security descriptor has the same owner and primary group as the original security descriptor. The new security descriptor is equivalent to the original security descriptor, so the caller needs no access rights or privileges to update the security descriptor to the new format. This function works with ACL_REVISION and ACL_REVISION_DS ACLs. ",

SANDBOX_INERT 0x2   If this value is used, the system does not check AppLocker rules  or apply Software Restriction Policies. For AppLocker, this flag disables checks for all four rule collections: Executable, Windows Installer, Script, and DLL. When creating a setup program that must run extracted DLLs during installation, use the flag SAFER_TOKEN_MAKE_INERT in the SaferComputeTokenFromLevel function. A token can be queried for existence of this flag by using GetTokenInformation. Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP:  On systems with KB2532445 installed, the caller must be running as LocalSystem or TrustedInstaller or the system ignores this flag. For more information, see  \"You can circumvent AppLocker rules by using an Office macro on a computer that is running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2\" in the Help and Support Knowledge Base at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2532445. Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP:  AppLocker is not supported. AppLocker was introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.   LUA_TOKEN 0x4   The new token is a LUA token. Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP:  This value is not supported.   WRITE_RESTRICTED 0x8   The new token contains restricting SIDs that are considered only when evaluating write access. Windows XP with SP2 and later:  The value of this constant is 0x4. For an application to be compatible with Windows XP with SP2 and later operating systems, the application should query the operating system by calling the GetVersionEx function to determine which value should be used. Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP with SP1 and earlier:  This value is not supported."

For example, if a user attempts to log on to RemoteDomain from a workstation in LocalDomain, the server for LocalDomain can request the SIDs for the user and the user's groups from RemoteDomain. The domain controller for RemoteDomain responds with the relevant SIDs. All SIDs for a specified domain have the same prefix. When the server receives the user's SIDs, the server can call the EqualPrefixSid function for each SID, comparing the user or group SID against the SID for RemoteDomain. If any of the SID prefixes are not equal, the server refuses the logon attempt. It is advisable to modify the SID for a domain before comparing it with a group or user SID. If the SID for RemoteDomain is S-1\u00e2\u0080\u00931234\u00e2\u0080\u00938, each group or user SID for that domain has S-1\u00e2\u0080\u00931234\u00e2\u0080\u00938 as its prefix. To compare the SIDs by using the EqualPrefixSid function, an application copies the domain SID and adds any subauthority (RID) value to the copy, thereby creating a SID in the form S-1\u00e2\u0080\u00931234\u00e2\u0080\u00938\u00e2\u0080\u00930.

SEF_MACL_NO_READ_UP 0x200   A principal with a mandatory level lower than that of the object cannot read the object.   SEF_MACL_NO_EXECUTE_UP 0x400   A principal with a mandatory level lower than that of the object cannot execute the object.   SEF_AVOID_OWNER_RESTRICTION 0x1000   Any restrictions  specified by the             owner of the object's parent that would limit the caller's ability to specify             a DACL in the ObjectsSecurityDescriptor are ignored."
