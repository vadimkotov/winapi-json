        "description": "Type: DWORD A set of APPCMD_, CBF_, and MF_ flags. The APPCMD_ flags provide special instructions to DdeInitialize. The CBF_ flags specify filters that prevent specific types of transactions from reaching the callback function. The MF_ flags specify the types of DDE activity that a DDE monitoring application monitors. Using these flags enhances the performance of a DDE application by eliminating unnecessary calls to the callback function.  This parameter can be one or more of the following values.   ValueMeaning  APPCLASS_MONITOR 0x00000001L   Makes it possible for the application to monitor DDE activity in the system. This flag is for use by DDE monitoring applications. The application specifies the types of DDE activity to monitor by combining one or more monitor flags with the APPCLASS_MONITOR flag. For details, see the following Remarks section.   APPCLASS_STANDARD 0x00000000L   Registers the application as a standard (nonmonitoring) DDEML application.   APPCMD_CLIENTONLY 0x00000010L   Prevents the application from becoming a server in a DDE conversation. The application can only be a client. This flag reduces consumption of resources by the DDEML. It includes the functionality of the CBF_FAIL_ALLSVRXACTIONS flag.   APPCMD_FILTERINITS 0x00000020L   Prevents the DDEML from sending XTYP_CONNECT and XTYP_WILDCONNECT transactions to the application until the application has created its string handles and registered its service names or has turned off filtering by a subsequent call to the DdeNameService or DdeInitialize function. This flag is always in effect when an application calls DdeInitialize for the first time, regardless of whether the application specifies the flag. On subsequent calls to DdeInitialize, not specifying this flag turns off the application's service-name filters, but specifying it turns on the application's service name filters.   CBF_FAIL_ALLSVRXACTIONS 0x0003f000   Prevents the callback function from receiving server transactions. The system returns DDE_FNOTPROCESSED to each client that sends a transaction to this application. This flag is equivalent to combining all CBF_FAIL_ flags.   CBF_FAIL_ADVISES 0x00004000   Prevents the callback function from receiving XTYP_ADVSTART and XTYP_ADVSTOP transactions. The system returns DDE_FNOTPROCESSED to each client that sends an XTYP_ADVSTART or XTYP_ADVSTOP transaction to the server.   CBF_FAIL_CONNECTIONS 0x00002000   Prevents the callback function from receiving XTYP_CONNECT and XTYP_WILDCONNECT transactions.   CBF_FAIL_EXECUTES 0x00008000   Prevents the callback function from receiving XTYP_EXECUTE transactions. The system returns DDE_FNOTPROCESSED to a client that sends an  \t\t\t\t\t\tXTYP_EXECUTE transaction to the server.   CBF_FAIL_POKES 0x00010000   Prevents the callback function from receiving XTYP_POKE transactions. The system returns DDE_FNOTPROCESSED to a client that sends an  \t\t\t\t\t\tXTYP_POKE transaction to the server.   CBF_FAIL_REQUESTS 0x00020000   Prevents the callback function from receiving XTYP_REQUEST transactions. The system returns DDE_FNOTPROCESSED to a client that sends an  \t\t\t\t\t\tXTYP_REQUEST transaction to the server.   CBF_FAIL_SELFCONNECTIONS 0x00001000   Prevents the callback function from receiving XTYP_CONNECT transactions from the application's own instance. This flag prevents an application from establishing a DDE conversation with its own instance. An application should use this flag if it needs to communicate with other instances of itself but not with itself.   CBF_SKIP_ALLNOTIFICATIONS 0x003c0000   Prevents the callback function from receiving any notifications. This flag is equivalent to combining all CBF_SKIP_ flags.   CBF_SKIP_CONNECT_CONFIRMS 0x00040000   Prevents the callback function from receiving XTYP_CONNECT_CONFIRM notifications.   CBF_SKIP_DISCONNECTS 0x00200000   Prevents the callback function from receiving XTYP_DISCONNECT notifications.   CBF_SKIP_REGISTRATIONS 0x00080000   Prevents the callback function from receiving XTYP_REGISTER notifications.   CBF_SKIP_UNREGISTRATIONS 0x00100000   Prevents the callback function from receiving XTYP_UNREGISTER notifications.   MF_CALLBACKS 0x08000000   Notifies the callback function whenever a transaction is sent to any DDE callback function in the system.   MF_CONV 0x40000000   Notifies the callback function whenever a conversation is established or terminated.   MF_ERRORS 0x10000000   Notifies the callback function whenever a DDE error occurs.   MF_HSZ_INFO 0x01000000   Notifies the callback function whenever a DDE application creates, frees, or increments the usage count of a string handle or whenever a string handle is freed as a result of a call to the DdeUninitialize function.   MF_LINKS 0x20000000   Notifies the callback function whenever an advise loop is started or ended.   MF_POSTMSGS 0x04000000   Notifies the callback function whenever the system or an application posts a DDE message.   MF_SENDMSGS 0x02000000   Notifies the callback function whenever the system or an application sends a DDE message."
