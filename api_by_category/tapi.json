With  lineConfigDialogEdit, the parameters to edit are passed in from the application, and the results are returned to the application, with no impact on active connections; the results of the editing are returned with this function, and the application does not need to call  lineGetDevConfig. Thus,  lineConfigDialogEdit permits an application to provide the ability for the user to set up parameters for future calls without having an impact on any active call.

If LINEERR_DIALBILLING, LINEERR_DIALQUIET, LINEERR_DIALDIALTONE, or LINEERR_DIALPROMPT is returned, none of the actions otherwise performed by  lineDial have occurred. For example, none of the dialable addresses prior to the offending character has been dialed, no hookswitch state has changed, and so on. The  lineDial function is used for dialing on an existing call appearance. For example, after a call has been set up for transfer or conference, a consultation call is automatically allocated, and the  lineDial function would be used to perform the dialing of this consultation call. The  lineDial function can be invoked multiple times in the course of multistage dialing, if the line's device capabilities allow it. Also, multiple addresses can be provided in a single dial string separated by CRLF. Service providers that provide inverse multiplexing can establish individual physical calls with each of the addresses and can return a single call handle to the aggregate of all calls to the application. All addresses would use the same country or region code. Dialing is considered complete after the address has been passed to the service provider; not after the call is finally connected. Service providers that provide inverse multiplexing can allow multiple addresses to be provided at once. The service provider sends LINE_CALLSTATE messages to the application to inform it about the progress of the call. To abort a call attempt while a call is being established, the invoking application should use  lineDrop. An application can set the lpszDestAddress parameter of the  lineDial function to the address of an empty string to indicate that dialing is complete, but only if the previous calls to the  lineMakeCall and  lineDial functions have had the strings specified by lpszDestAddress terminated with semicolons. The lineDial function can also be used in partial dialing.  To initiate a call using partial dialing, the application calls lineMakeCall and specifies a partial dialing string. A partial dial string is any dial string  terminated by a semicolon.  The call will typically transition to LINECALLSTATE_DIALING after which lineDial can be called to specify  more dialing strings, each terminated by a semicolon.  Dialing is completed by calling lineDial with a dial string that is not terminated with a semicolon (such as an empty string).  This technique allows applications to perform interactive partial dialing with the user  or enable  more sophisticated dialing than a TSP may be capable of. If a null destination string, or an empty string terminated with a semicolon (\";\") is entered in   lineMakeCall the application transitions to LINE_CALLSTATE_DIALTONE. The  lineDial function can  be called in this state to enter a single dial string  or  multiple partial dial strings, each separated by a semicolon. The application transitions to the  LINECALLSTATE_DIALING state after the first digit is entered. ",

Invoking  lineDrop on a call in the offering state rejects the call. Not all telephone networks provide this capability. A call in the onholdpending state typically reverts to the connected state. When dropping the consultation call to the third party for a conference call or when removing the third party in a previously established conference call, the provider (and switch) can release the conference bridge and revert the call back to a normal two-party call. If this is the case, hConfCall transitions to the idle state, and the only remaining participating call transitions to the connected state. Some switches automatically \"unhold\" the other call. The application has the option to send user-user information at the time of the drop. Even if user-user information can be sent, there is no guarantee that the network will deliver this information to the remote party. In various bridged or party-line configurations when multiple parties are on the call,  lineDrop may not actually clear the call. For example, in a bridged situation, a  lineDrop operation may not actually drop the call because the status of other stations on the call may govern; instead, the call may simply be changed to the LINECONNECTEDMODE_INACTIVE mode if it remains connected at other stations.

A  LINE_ADDRESSSTATE (forwarding) message provides confirmation for forwarding having been set up at the switch. Forwarding of the address(es) remains in effect until this function is called again. The most recent forwarding list replaces the old one. Forwarding can be canceled by specifying a NULL pointer as lpForwardList. If a NULL destination address is specified for an entry in the forwarding list, the operation acts as a do-not-disturb. Forwarding status of an address can also be affected externally; for example, by administrative actions at the switch or by a user from another station. It may not be possible for the service provider to be aware of this state change, and it may not be able to keep in synchronization with the forwarding state known to the switch. Because a service provider may not know the forwarding state of the address \"for sure\" (that is, it may have been forwarded or unforwarded in an unknown way),  lineForward succeeds unless it fails to set the new forwarding instructions.

The success or failure of this operation does not depend on the previous set of forwarding instructions, and the same is true when setting different forwarding instructions. The provider should \"unforward everything\" prior to setting the new forwarding instructions. Because this can take time in analog telephony environments, a provider may also want to compare the current forwarding with the new one, and only issue instructions to the switch to get to the final state (leaving unchanged forwarding unaffected).

It is also terminated when one of the digits detected matches a digit in szTerminationDigits before the specified number of digits has been collected. The detected termination digit is also placed in the buffer and the partial buffer is returned. Another way of canceling digit collection occurs when one of the timeouts expires. The dwFirstDigitTimeout expires if the first digit is not received in this time period. The dwInterDigitTimout expires if the second, third, (and so forth) digit is not received within that time period from the previously detected digit, and a partial buffer is returned. A fourth method for terminating digit collection is by calling this function again while collection is in progress. The old collection session is terminated, any digits collected up to that point are copied to the buffer supplied from the previous call to this function, and the buffer is delivered when the  LINE_GATHERDIGITS message is sent to the application. The mechanism for terminating digit gathering without initiating another gathering of the digits is to invoke this function with lpsDigits equal to NULL. This function is considered successful if digit collection has been correctly initiated, not if digit collection has terminated. In all cases where a partial buffer is returned, valid digits (if any) are followed by a NULL character. Although this function can be invoked in any call state, digits can typically only be gathered while the call is in the connected state. The message LINE_GATHERDIGITS is sent only to the application that initiated the request. It is also sent when partial buffers are returned because of timeouts or matching termination digits, or when the request is canceled by another  lineGatherDigits request on the call. Only one gather-digits request can be active on a call at any given time across all applications that are owners of the call. Given the asynchronous behavior of the operation, an application that issues multiple  lineGatherDigits requests in quick succession may be able to do so and receive several LINE_GATHERDIGITS messages later. While this would be unusual application behavior, the application is able to count the number of these messages to allow cancel messages to be matched with the earlier requests. In any case, only the most recent request should be assumed to be valid. An application can use  lineMonitorDigits to enable or disable unbuffered digit detection. Each time a digit is detected in this fashion, a  LINE_MONITORDIGITS message is sent to the application. Both buffered and unbuffered digit detection can be simultaneously enabled for the same call. Gathering of digits on a conference call applies only to the hConfCall, not to the individual participating calls. If the  lineGatherDigits function is used to cancel a previous request to gather digits, the function copies any digits collected up to that point to the buffer specified in the original function call. The function then sends a LINE_GATHERDIGITS message to the application, regardless of whether the lpszDigits parameter in the second call specifies a NULL or different address. ",

The icon handle is for a resource associated with the provider. The application must use  CopyIcon if it wants to reference the icon after the provider is unloaded, which is unlikely to happen as long as the application has the line open. The lpszDeviceClass parameter allows the provider to return different icons based on the type of service being referenced by the caller. The permitted strings are the same as for  lineGetID. For example, if the line supports the Comm API, passing \"COMM\" as lpszDeviceClass causes the provider to return an icon related specifically to the Comm device functions of the service provider. The parameters \"tapi/line\", \"\", or NULL can be used to request the icon for the line service. For applications using an API version earlier than 2.0, if the provider does not return an icon (whether because the given device class is invalid or the provider does not support icons), TAPI substitutes a generic  Telephony line device icon. For applications using API version 2.0 or later, TAPI substitutes the default line icon only if the lpszDeviceClass parameter is \"tapi/line\", \"\" or NULL. For any other device class, if the given device class is not valid or the provider does not support icons for the class,  lineGetIcon returns LINEERR_INVALDEVICECLASS. ",

Next, the call-control application that receives this message invokes  lineGetRequest, specifying the request mode and a buffer that is large enough to hold the request. The call-control application then interprets and executes the request. After execution of  lineGetRequest, TAPI purges the request from its internal queue, making room available for a subsequent request. It is therefore possible for a new  LINE_REQUEST message to be received immediately upon execution of  lineGetRequest, should the same or another application issue another request. It is the responsibility of the request recipient application to handle this scenario by some mechanism; for example, by noting the additional LINE_REQUEST and deferring a subsequent  lineGetRequest until processing of the preceding request completes, by getting the subsequent request and buffer as necessary, or by another appropriate means.

    "remarks": "The  lineHandoff function returns LINEERR_TARGETSELF if the calling application attempted an indirect handoff (that is, set the lpszFileName parameter to NULL) and TAPI determined that the application is itself the highest priority application for the given media mode. If LINEERR_TARGETNOTFOUND is returned, a target for the call handoff was not found. This can occur if the named application did not open the same line with the LINECALLPRIVILEGE_OWNER bit in the dwPrivileges parameter of  lineOpen. Or, in the case of media-mode handoff, no application has opened the same line with the LINECALLPRIVILEGE_OWNER bit in the dwPrivileges parameter of  lineOpen and with the media mode specified in the dwMediaModes parameter of  lineOpen. Call handoff allows ownership of a call to be passed among applications. There are two types of handoff. In the first type, if the application knows the file name of the target application, it can simply specify that file name. If an instance of the target application has opened the line device, ownership of the call is passed to the other application; otherwise, the handoff fails and an error is returned. This form of handoff succeeds if the call handle is handed off to the same file name as the application requesting the handoff. The second type of handoff is based on media mode. In this case, the application indirectly specifies the target application by means of a media mode. The highest priority application that has currently opened the line device for that media mode is the target for the handoff. If there is no such application, the handoff fails and an error is returned. The  lineHandoff function does not change the media mode of a call. To change the media mode of a call, the application should use  lineSetMediaMode on the call, specifying the new media mode. This changes the call's media mode as stored in the call's  LINECALLINFO structure. If handoff succeeds, the receiving application receives a  LINE_CALLSTATE message for the call. This message indicates that the receiving application has owner privilege to the call (dwParam3). In addition, the number of owners and/or monitors for the call may have changed. This is reported by the  LINE_CALLINFO message, and the receiving application can then invoke  lineGetCallStatus and  lineGetCallInfo to retrieve more information about the received call. The receiving application should first check the media mode in  LINECALLINFO. If only a single media mode flag is set, the call is officially of that media mode, and the application can act accordingly. If UNKNOWN and other media mode flags are set, then the media mode of the call is officially UNKNOWN but is assumed to be of one of the media modes for which a flag is set in  LINECALLINFO. The application should assume that it ought to probe for the highest priority media mode. If the probe succeeds (either for that media mode or for another one), the application should set the media mode member in  LINECALLINFO to the single media mode that was recognized. If the media mode flag matches the  LINECALLINFO media mode, the application can act accordingly. If it makes a determination for another media mode, it must first hand off the call to that media mode. If the probe fails, the application should clear the corresponding media mode flag in  LINECALLINFO and hand off the call, specifying dwMediaMode as LINEMEDIAMODE_UNKNOWN. It should also deallocate its call handle (or revert back to monitoring). If none of the media modes succeeded in making a determination, only the UNKNOWN flag remains set in the media mode field of  LINECALLINFO at the time the media application attempts to hand off the call to UNKNOWN. The final  lineHandoff fails if the application is the only remaining owner of the call. This informs the application that it should drop the call and deallocate its handle, in which case the call is abandoned. The privileges of the invoking application to the call are unchanged by this operation, but the application can change its privileges to a call with  lineSetCallPrivilege. ",

If the application is not monitoring and not using any devices, it should call  lineShutdown so that memory resources allocated by Tapi.dll can be released if unneeded, and Tapi.dll itself can be unloaded from memory while not needed. Another reason for performing a  lineShutdown is that if a user changes the device configuration (adds or removes a line or phone), there is no way for TAPI to notify an application that has a line or phone handle open at the time.

    "remarks": "Applications must select one of three mechanisms by which TAPI notifies the application of telephony events: Hidden Window, Event Handle, or Completion Port. The Hidden Window mechanism is selected by specifying LINEINITIALIZEEXOPTION_USEHIDDENWINDOW in the dwOptions member in the  LINEINITIALIZEEXPARAMS structure. In this mechanism (which is the only mechanism available to TAPI verson 1.x applications), TAPI creates a window in the context of the application during the  lineInitializeEx or  lineInitialize (for TAPI version 1.3 and 1.4 applications) function, and subclasses the window so that all messages posted to it are handled by a WNDPROC in TAPI itself. When TAPI has a message to deliver to the application, TAPI posts a message to the hidden window. When the message is received (which can happen only when the application calls the Windows  GetMessage function), Windows switches the process context to that of the application and invokes the WNDPROC in TAPI. TAPI then delivers the message to the application by calling the lineCallbackProc, a pointer to which the application provided as a parameter in its call to  lineInitializeEx (or  lineInitialize). This mechanism requires the application to have a message queue (which is not desirable for service processes) and to service that queue regularly to avoid delaying processing of telephony events. The hidden window is destroyed by TAPI during the  lineShutdown function. The Event Handle mechanism is selected by specifying LINEINITIALIZEEXOPTION_USEEVENT in the dwOptions member in the  LINEINITIALIZEEXPARAMS structure. In this mechanism, TAPI creates an event object on behalf of the application, and returns a handle to the object in the hEvent member in  LINEINITIALIZEEXPARAMS. The application must not manipulate this event in any manner (for example, must not call  SetEvent,  ResetEvent,  CloseHandle, and so on) or undefined behavior results; the application can only wait on this event using functions such as  WaitForSingleObject or  MsgWaitForMultipleObjects. TAPI signals this event whenever a telephony event notification is pending for the application; the application must call  lineGetMessage to fetch the contents of the message. The event is reset by TAPI when no events are pending. The event handle is closed and the event object destroyed by TAPI during the  lineShutdown function. The application is not required to wait on the event handle that is created; the application could choose instead to call  lineGetMessage and have it block waiting for a message to be queued. The Completion Port mechanism is selected by specifying LINEINITIALIZEEXOPTION_USECOMPLETION PORT in the dwOptions member in the  LINEINITIALIZEEXPARAMS structure. In this mechanism, whenever a telephony event needs to be sent to the application, TAPI sends it using  PostQueuedCompletionStatus to the completion port that the application specified in the hCompletionPort member in  LINEINITIALIZEEXPARAMS, tagged with the completion key that the application specified in the dwCompletionKey member in  LINEINITIALIZEEXPARAMS. The application must have previously created the completion port using  CreateIoCompletionPort. The application retrieves events using  GetQueuedCompletionStatus. Upon return from GetQueuedCompletionStatus, the application has the specified dwCompletionKey written to the DWORD pointed to by the lpCompletionKey parameter, and a pointer to a  LINEMESSAGE structure returned to the location pointed to by lpOverlapped. After the application has processed the event, it is the application's responsibility to call  LocalFree to release the memory used to contain the  LINEMESSAGE structure. Because the application created the completion port (thereby allowing it to be shared for other purposes), the application must close it; the application must not close the completion port until after calling  lineShutdown. When a multithreaded application is using the Event Handle mechanism and more than one thread is waiting on the handle, or the Completion Port notification mechanism and more than one thread is waiting on the port, it is possible for telephony events to be processed out of sequence. This is not due to the sequence of delivery of events from TAPI, but would be caused by the time slicing of threads or the execution of threads on separate processors. If LINEERR_REINIT is returned and TAPI reinitialization has been requested, for example as a result of adding or removing a telephony service provider, then  lineInitializeEx requests are rejected with this error until the last application shuts down its usage of the API (using  lineShutdown), at which time the new configuration becomes effective and applications are once again permitted to call  lineInitializeEx. If the LINEERR_INVALPARAM error value is returned, the specified hInstance parameter is invalid. The application can refer to individual line devices by using line device identifiers that range from zero to dwNumDevs minus one. An application should not assume that these line devices are capable of any particular TAPI function without first querying their device capabilities by  lineGetDevCaps and  lineGetAddressCaps. ",

",
    "remarks": "The media types specified with  lineOpen relate only to enabling the detection of these media types by the service provider for the purpose of handing off new incoming calls to the proper application. They do not impact any of the media-mode notification messages that are expected because of a previous invocation of  lineMonitorMedia. This function is considered successful if media type monitoring has been correctly initiated, not when media type monitoring has terminated. Media monitoring for a given media type remains in effect until it is explicitly disabled by calling  lineMonitorMedia with a dwMediaModes parameter set to zero, until the call transitions to idle, or when the application deallocates its call handle for the call. The  lineMonitorMedia function is primarily an event reporting mechanism. The media type (mode) of the call, as indicated in  LINECALLINFO, is not affected by the service provider's detection of the media type. Only the controlling application can change a call's media type. Default media monitoring performed by the service provider corresponds to the union of all media types specified on  lineOpen. Although this function can be invoked in any call state, a call's media type can typically only be detected while the call is in certain call states. These states can be device specific. For example, in ISDN, a message can indicate the media type of the media stream before the media stream exists. Similarly, distinctive ringing or the called identifier information about the call can be used to identify the media type of a call. Otherwise, the call may have to be answered (call in the connected state) to allow a service provider to determine the call's media type by filtering the media stream. Because filtering a call's media stream implies a computational overhead, applications should disable media monitoring when not required. By default, media monitoring is enabled for newly incoming calls, because a call's media type selects the application that should handle the call. An outgoing application that deals with voice media types may want to monitor the call for silence (a tone) to distinguish who or what is at the called end of a call. For example, a person at home can answer calls with just a short \"hello.\" A person in the office can provide a longer greeting, indicating name and company name. An answering machine can typically have an even longer greeting. Because media-mode detection enabled by  lineMonitorMedia is implemented as a read-only operation of the call's media stream, it is not disruptive. Monitoring of media on a conference call applies only to the hConfCall parameter, not to the individual participating calls. ",

    "remarks": "If LINEERR_ALLOCATED is returned, the line cannot be opened due to a \"persistent\" condition, such as that of a serial port being exclusively opened by another process. If LINEERR_RESOURCEUNAVAIL is returned, the line cannot be opened due to a dynamic resource overcommitment such as in DSP processor cycles or memory. This overcommitment can be transitory, caused by monitoring of media type or tones, and changes in these activities by other applications can make it possible to reopen the line within a short time period. If LINEERR_REINIT is returned and TAPI reinitialization has been requested (for example, as a result of adding or removing a telephony service provider), then  lineOpen requests are rejected with this error until the last application shuts down its usage of the API (using  lineShutdown); at that time the new configuration becomes effective and applications are once again permitted to call  lineInitializeEx. Opening a line always entitles the application to make calls on any address available on the line. The ability of the application to deal with incoming calls or to be the target of call handoffs on the line is determined by the dwMediaModes parameter. The  lineOpen function registers the application as having an interest in monitoring calls or receiving ownership of calls that are of the specified media types. If the application just wants to monitor calls, then it can specify LINECALLPRIVILEGE_MONITOR. If the application just wants to make outgoing calls, it can specify LINECALLPRIVILEGE_NONE. If the application is willing to control unclassified calls (calls of unknown media type), it can specify LINECALLPRIVILEGE_OWNER and LINEMEDIAMODE_UNKNOWN. Otherwise, the application should specify the media type it is interested in handling. The application can call the lineSetCallPrivilege function to change the call privileges specified by the LINECALLPRIVILEGES_Constants. The media types specified with  lineOpen add to the default value for the provider's media type monitoring for initial incoming call type determination. The  lineMonitorMedia function modifies the mask that controls  LINE_MONITORMEDIA messages. If a line device is opened with owner privilege and an extension media type is not registered, then the error LINEERR_INVALMEDIAMODE is returned. An application that has successfully opened a line device can always initiate calls using  lineMakeCall,  lineUnpark,  linePickup, and  lineSetupConference (with a NULLhCall), as well as use  lineForward (assuming that doing so is allowed by the device capabilities, line state, and so on). A single application can specify multiple flags simultaneously to handle multiple media types. Conflicts can arise if multiple applications open the same line device for the same media type. These conflicts are resolved by a priority scheme in which the user assigns relative priorities to the applications. Users can set application priorities by calling the lineSetAppPriority function. Only the highest priority application for a given media type will ever receive ownership (unsolicited) of a call of that media type. Ownership can be received when an incoming call first arrives or when a call is handed off. The lineHandoff function is called to hand off ownership of a call to another application. If the user does not assign priorities to the application, and multiple applications open the same line device, by default, the application that called lineOpen first will have the highest priority. Any application (including any lower priority application) can always acquire ownership with  lineGetNewCalls or  lineGetConfRelatedCalls. If an application opens a line for monitoring at a time that calls exist on the line,  LINE_CALLSTATE messages for those existing calls are not automatically generated to the new monitoring application. The application can query the number of current calls on the line to determine how many calls exist, and, if it wants, it can call  lineGetNewCalls to obtain handles to these calls. An application that handles automated voice should also select the interactive voice open mode and be assigned the lowest priority for interactive voice. The reason for this is that service providers report all voice media types as interactive voice. If media type determination is not performed by the application for the UNKNOWN media type, and no interactive voice application has opened the line device, voice calls would be unable to reach the automated voice application, and would be dropped. The same application, or different instantiations of the same application, can open the same line multiple times with the same or different parameters. When an application opens a line device it must specify the negotiated API version and, if it wants to use the line's extensions, it should specify the line's device-specific extension version. These version numbers should have been obtained with  lineNegotiateAPIVersion and  lineNegotiateExtVersion. Version numbering allows the mixing and matching of different application versions with different API versions and service provider versions. LINEMAPPER allows an application to select a line indirectly\u00e2\u0080\u0094by means of the services it wants from it. When opening a line device using LINEMAPPER, the following is true: All members from beginning of the  LINECALLPARAMS data structure through dwAddressMode are relevant. If dwAddressMode is LINEADDRESSMODE_ADDRESSID it means that any address on the line is acceptable, otherwise if dwAddressMode is LINEADDRESSMODE_DIALABLEADDR, indicating that a specific originating address (phone number) is searched for, or if it is a provider-specific extension, then dwOrigAddressSize/Offset and the portion of the variable part they refer to are also relevant. If dwAddressMode is a provider-specific extension, additional information can be contained in the dwDeviceSpecific variably sized member. ",

If the LINEOPENOPTION_SINGLEADDRESS option is specified, then the application is interested only in new calls that appear on the address specified by the dwAddressID member in the  LINECALLPARAMS structure pointed to by the lpCallParams parameter (which must be specified). If LINEOPENOPTION_SINGLEADDRESS is specified but either lpCallParams is invalid or the included dwAddressID does not exist on the line, the open fails with LINERR_INVALADDRESSID. In addition to setting the dwAddressID member of the  LINECALLPARAMS structure to the desired address, the application must also set dwAddressMode in  LINECALLPARAMS to LINEADDRESSMODE_ADDRESSID. The LINEOPENOPTION_SINGLEADDRESS option affects only TAPI's assignment of initial call ownership of calls created by the service provider using a  LINE_NEWCALL message. An application that opens the line with LINECALLPRIVILEGE_MONITOR continues to receive monitoring handles to all calls created on the line. Furthermore, the application is not restricted in any way from making calls or performing other operations that affect other addresses on the opened line. When the LINEOPENOPTION_PROXY option is specified (TAPI 2.0 or higher only), the application must also indicate which specific proxy requests it is prepared to handle.

Each element of this array shall contain one of the  LINEPROXYREQUEST_ Constants.

The proxy request handler application can run on any machine that has authorization to control the line device. However, requests are always routed through the server on which the service provider is executing that actually controls the line device. Thus, it is most efficient if the application handling proxy requests (such as ACD agent control) executes directly on the server along with the service provider. Subsequent attempts, by the same application or other applications, to open the line device and register to handle the same proxy requests as an application that is already registered fail with LINEERR_NOTREGISTERED.

This function can be called at any time, even when a call is active on the given line device. This allows a user to switch from using the local phone set to another audio I/O device. This function can be called multiple times to route the same events to multiple terminals simultaneously. To reroute events to a different terminal, the application should first disable routing to the existing terminal and then route the events to the new terminal. Terminal identifier assignments are made by the line's service provider. Device capabilities indicate only which terminal identifiers the service provider has available. Service providers that do not support this type of event routing would indicate that they have no terminal devices (dwNumTerminals in  LINEDEVCAPS would be zero). Invoking  lineSetTerminal on a line or address affects all existing calls on that line or address, but does not affect calls on other addresses. It also sets the default for future calls on that line or address. A line or address that has multiple connected calls active at one time can have different routing in effect for each call. Disabling the routing of low-level events to a terminal when these events are not currently routed to or from that terminal does not necessarily generate an error so long as the function succeeds (the specified events are not routed to or from that terminal). TAPI routes call progress tones and messages to the same location as set by the  lineSetTerminal function for \"media\".

If LINEERR_INVALMEDIAMODE is returned, check for supported media types on the line in the dwMediaModes member in the  LINEDEVCAPS structure. The  lineSetupConference function provides two ways to establish a new conference call, depending on whether a normal two-party call is required to pre-exist or not. When setting up a conference call from an existing two-party call, the hCall parameter is a valid call handle that is initially added to the conference call by the  lineSetupConference request; hLine is ignored. On switches where conference call setup does not start with an existing call, hCall must be NULL and hLine must be specified to identify the line device on which to initiate the conference call. In either case, a consultation call is allocated for connecting to the party that is to be added to the call. The application can then use  lineDial to dial the address of the other party. The conference call typically transitions into the onHoldPendingConference state, the consultation call into the dialtone state, and the initial call (if there is one) into the conferenced state. A conference call can also be set up by a  lineCompleteTransfer that is resolved into a three-way conference. The application may be able to toggle between the consultation call and the conference call using  lineSwapHold. A consultation call can be canceled by invoking  lineDrop on it. When dropping a consultation call, the existing conference call typically transitions back to the connected state. The application should observe the LINE_CALLSTATE messages to determine exactly what happens to the calls. For example, if the conference call reverts back to a regular two-party call, the conference call becomes idle and the original participant call can revert to connected. If an application specifies the handle of the original call (hCall) in a call to the  lineUnhold function, both the conference call and the consultation call typically go to idle. ",

When opening a phone with owner privilege, the phone device can be manipulated in ways that affect the state of the phone device. An application should only open a phone using owner privilege if it actively wants to manipulate the phone device, and it should close the phone device when finished to allow other applications to control the phone. When an application opens a phone device, it must specify the negotiated API version and, if it wants to use the phone's extensions, the phone's device-specific extension version. This version number should have been obtained with the  phoneNegotiateAPIVersion and  phoneNegotiateExtVersion functions. Version numbering allows the mix and match of different application versions with different API versions and service-provider versions. ",
