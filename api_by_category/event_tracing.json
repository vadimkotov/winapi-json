Typically, if a provider has been enabled, it generates events, but while it is disabled, it does not. Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) supports several categories of filtering. Every time EnableTraceEx2 is called, the filters for the provider in that session are replaced by the new parameters defined by the parameters passed to the EnableTraceEx2 function. Multiple filters passed in a single EnableTraceEx2 call can be combined with an additive effect. To disable filtering and thereby enable all providers/events in the logging session, call EnableTraceEx2 with the EnableParameters parameter pointed to an ENABLE_TRACE_PARAMETERS structure with the FilterDescCount member set to 0. Each filter passed to the EnableTraceEx2 function is specified by a Type member in the EVENT_FILTER_DESCRIPTOR. An array of  EVENT_FILTER_DESCRIPTOR structures is passed in the ENABLE_TRACE_PARAMETERS structure passed in the EnableParameters parameter to the EnableTraceEx2 function. Each type of filter (a specific Type member) may only appear once in a call to the EnableTraceEx2 function, however, some filter  types allow multiple conditions to be included in a single filter. The maximum number of filters that can be included in a call to EnableTraceEx2 is set by  MAX_EVENT_FILTERS_COUNT defined to be 8 in the Evntprov.h header file.  Each filter type has its own size or entity limits based on the specific Type member in the EVENT_FILTER_DESCRIPTOR structure.  The list  below indicates these limits.  To include all events that a provider provides, set MatchAnyKeyword to zero (for a      manifest-based provider or TraceLogging provider      and 0xFFFFFFFF for a      classic provider). To      include specific events, set the MatchAnyKeyword mask to those specific events. To indicate that you wish to enable a Provider Group, use the EVENT_ENABLE_PROPERTY_PROVIDER_GROUP flag on the EnableProperty member of  EnableParameters. For      example, if the provider defines an event for its initialization and cleanup routines (set keyword bit 0), an      event for its file operations (set keyword bit 1), and an event for its calculation operations (set keyword bit      2), you can set MatchAnyKeyword to 5 to receive initialization and cleanup events and      calculation events. If the provider defines more complex event keywords, for example, the provider defines an event that sets bit      0 for read and bit 1 for local access and a second event that sets bit 0 for read and bit 2 for remote access, you      could set MatchAnyKeyword to 1 to receive all read events, or you could set MatchAnykeyword to 1 and      MatchAllKeywords to 3 to receive local reads only. If an event's keyword is zero, the provider will write the event to the session, regardless of the      MatchAnyKeyword and MatchAllKeyword masks. When you call EnableTraceEx2 the provider may or may      not be registered. If the provider is registered, ETW calls the provider's callback function, if it implements      one, and the session begins receiving events. If the provider is not registered, ETW will call the provider's      callback function when it registers itself, if it implements one, and the session will begin receiving events. If      the provider is not registered, the provider's callback function will not receive the source ID or filter data.      You can call EnableTraceEx2 one time to enable a      provider before the provider registers itself. If the provider is registered and already enabled to your session, you can also use this function to update      the Level, MatchAnyKeyword,      MatchAllKeyword parameters, and the EnableProperty and      EnableFilterDesc members of EnableParameters. On Windows 8.1,Windows Server 2012 R2, and later, event payload , scope, and stack       walk filters can be used by the EnableTraceEx2       function and the ENABLE_TRACE_PARAMETERS and       EVENT_FILTER_DESCRIPTOR structures to filter on       specific conditions in a logger session. For more information on event payload filters, see the       TdhCreatePayloadFilter, and       TdhAggregatePayloadFilters functions and       the ENABLE_TRACE_PARAMETERS,       EVENT_FILTER_DESCRIPTOR, and       PAYLOAD_FILTER_PREDICATE structures. You do not call EnableTraceEx2 to enable kernel       providers. To enable kernel providers, set the EnableFlags member of       EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES which you then pass to       StartTrace. The       StartTrace function enables the selected kernel       providers. Up to eight trace sessions can enable and receive events from the same manifest-based provider or TraceLogging provider; however, only one trace session can enable a classic provider. If more than one session tried to enable a classic provider, the first session would stop receiving events when the second session enabled the same provider. For example, if Session A enabled Provider 1 and then Session B enabled Provider 1, only Session B would receive events from Provider 1.

To determine the level and keywords used to enable a manifest-based provider, use one of the following       commands: For classic providers, it is up to the provider to document and make available to potential controllers the severity levels or enable flags that it supports. If the provider wants to be enabled by any controller, the provider should accept 0 for the severity level and enable flags and interpret 0 as a request to perform default logging (whatever that may be). If you use EnableTraceEx2 to enable a classic provider, the following translation occurs: If EnableTraceEx2 returns       ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER when enabling filtering, you can turn on tracing to view       debugging messages about the failure. This requires a checked build. The following example shows you how to use the       EnableTraceEx2 with payload filters using the       TdhCreatePayloadFilter and       TdhAggregatePayloadFilters functions to       filter on specific conditions in a logger session.

Classic providers needed to specify and implement a callback because it used the information that was passed to the callback to determine the types of events to log and the level of verboseness to use when logging the events. However, with manifest-based providers, the callback is optional and is used for informational purposes; you do not need to specify or implement the callback when registering the provider unless your provider supports filtering. Providers can now just write events and ETW will determine if the event is logged to the session. If you want to verify that the event should be written before writing the event, you can call either the EventEnabled or  EventProviderEnabled function. Each time a new session enables the provider or a current session updates the provider, ETW calls the provider's callback function, if implemented. The level value that ETW passes to the callback is the highest level value specified amongst all the sessions. For example, if session A enabled the provider for warning (3) events and then session B enabled the provider for critical (1) events, the level value for the second callback is also 3, not 1. The MatchAnyKeyword value that ETW passes to the callback is a composite value of all MatchAnyKeyword values specified for all sessions that enabled the provider. The same is true for the MatchAllKeywords value. The SourceId and FilterData values are those values passed to the EnableTraceEx call.

Since the manifest is embedded in the provider, the      provider must be available for a consumer  to consume the data written by the provider. Use the ActivityId and RelatedActivityId parameters when      several components want to relate their events in an end-to-end tracing scenario. For example, components A, B,      and C perform work on a related activity and want to link their events so that a consumer can consume  all the      events related to that activity.  ETW uses thread local storage to make available to the next component the      previous component's activity identifier. The component retrieves from the local storage the previous component's      identifier and sets the related activity identifier to it. The consumer can then use the related activity      identifier to walk the chain of the events from one component to the next. If each component defined their own activity identifier, the components can make the following calls to link       the events: A provider can define filters that a session uses to filter events based on event data. With level and keywords, ETW determines whether the event is written to the session but with filters, the provider uses the filter data to determine whether it writes the event to the session. For example, if your provider generates process events, you could define a data filter that filters process events based on the process identifier. If the identifier of the process did not match the identifier that the session passed as filter data, you would set (perform a bitwise OR) the Filter parameter to the session's instance identifier to prevent the event from being written to that session.
