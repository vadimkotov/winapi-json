Note that GetMessage always retrieves WM_QUIT messages, no matter which values you specify for wMsgFilterMin and wMsgFilterMax. During this call, the system delivers pending, nonqueued messages, that is, messages sent to windows owned by the calling thread using the SendMessage, SendMessageCallback, SendMessageTimeout, or SendNotifyMessage function. Then the first queued message that matches the specified filter is retrieved. The system may also process internal events. If no filter is specified, messages are processed in the following order: To retrieve input messages before posted messages, use the wMsgFilterMin and wMsgFilterMax parameters. GetMessage does not remove WM_PAINT messages from the queue. The messages remain in the queue until processed. If a top-level window stops responding to messages for more than several seconds, the system considers the window to be not responding and replaces it with a ghost window that has the same z-order, location, size, and visual attributes. This allows the user to move it, resize it, or even close the application. However, these are the only actions available because the application is actually not responding.

Note that PeekMessage always retrieves WM_QUIT messages, no matter which values you specify for wMsgFilterMin and wMsgFilterMax. During this call, the system delivers pending,  nonqueued messages, that is, messages sent to windows owned by the calling thread using the SendMessage, SendMessageCallback, SendMessageTimeout, or SendNotifyMessage function. Then the first queued message that matches the specified filter is retrieved. The system may also process internal events. If no filter is specified, messages are processed in the following order: To retrieve input messages before posted messages, use the wMsgFilterMin and wMsgFilterMax parameters. The PeekMessage function normally does not remove WM_PAINT messages from the queue. WM_PAINT messages remain in the queue until they are processed. However, if a WM_PAINT message has a NULL update region, PeekMessage does remove it from the queue. If a top-level window stops responding to messages for more than several seconds, the system considers the window to be not responding and replaces it with a ghost window that has the same z-order, location, size, and visual attributes. This allows the user to move it, resize it, or even close the application. However, these are the only actions available because the application is actually not responding. When an application is being debugged, the system does not generate a ghost window. For an example, see Examining a Message Queue. ",
