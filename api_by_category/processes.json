    "remarks": "By default,  CreateProcessWithLogonW does not load the specified user profile into the HKEY_USERS registry key. This means that access to information in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry key may not produce results that are consistent with a normal interactive logon. It is your responsibility to load the user registry hive into HKEY_USERS before calling  CreateProcessWithLogonW, by using LOGON_WITH_PROFILE, or by calling the  LoadUserProfile function. If the lpEnvironment parameter is NULL, the new process uses an environment block created from the profile of the user specified by lpUserName. If the HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH variables are not set, CreateProcessWithLogonW modifies the environment block to use the drive and path of the user's working directory. When created, the new process and thread handles receive full access rights (PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS and THREAD_ALL_ACCESS). For either handle, if a security descriptor is not provided, the handle can be used in any function that requires an object handle of that type. When a security descriptor is provided, an access check is performed on all subsequent uses of the handle before access is granted. If access is denied, the requesting process cannot use the handle to gain access to the process or thread. To retrieve a security token, pass the process handle in the  PROCESS_INFORMATION structure to the  OpenProcessToken function. The process is assigned a process identifier. The identifier is valid until the process terminates. It can be used to identify the process, or it can be specified in the  OpenProcess function to open a handle to the process. The initial thread in the process is also assigned a thread identifier. It can be specified in the  OpenThread function to open a handle to the thread. The identifier is valid until the thread terminates and can be used to uniquely identify the thread within the system. These identifiers are returned in  PROCESS_INFORMATION. The calling thread can use the  WaitForInputIdle function to wait until the new process has completed its initialization and is waiting for user input with no input pending. This can be useful for synchronization between parent and child processes, because  CreateProcessWithLogonW returns without waiting for the new process to finish its initialization. For example, the creating process would use  WaitForInputIdle before trying to find a window that is associated with the new process. The preferred way to shut down a process is by using the  ExitProcess function, because this function sends notification of approaching termination to all DLLs attached to the process. Other means of shutting down a process do not notify the attached DLLs. Note that when a thread calls  ExitProcess, other threads of the process are terminated without an opportunity to execute any additional code (including the thread termination code of attached DLLs). For more information, see  Terminating a Process. CreateProcessWithLogonW accesses the specified directory and executable image in the security context of the target user. If the executable image is on a network and a network drive letter is specified in the path, the network drive letter is not available to the target user, as network drive letters can be assigned for each logon. If a network drive letter is specified, this function fails. If the executable image is on a network, use the UNC path. There is a limit to the number of child processes that can be created by this function and run simultaneously. For example, on Windows XP, this limit is MAXIMUM_WAIT_OBJECTS*4. However, you may not be able to create this many processes due to system-wide quota limits. Windows XP with SP2,Windows Server 2003, or later:  You cannot call CreateProcessWithLogonW from a process that is running under the \"LocalSystem\" account,  because the function uses the logon SID in the caller token, and the token for the \"LocalSystem\" account does not contain this SID. As an alternative, use the CreateProcessAsUser and LogonUser functions. To compile an application that uses this function, define _WIN32_WINNT as 0x0500 or later. For more information, see  Using the Windows Headers. The lpApplicationName parameter can be NULL, and  the executable name must be the first white space\u00e2\u0080\u0093delimited string in lpCommandLine. If the executable or path name has a space in it, there is a risk that a different executable could be run because of the way the function parses spaces. Avoid the following example, because the function attempts to run \"Program.exe\", if it exists, instead of \"MyApp.exe\". If a malicious user creates an application called \"Program.exe\" on a system, any program that incorrectly calls  CreateProcessWithLogonW using the Program Files directory runs the malicious user application instead of the intended application. To avoid this issue, do not pass NULL for lpApplicationName. If you pass NULL for lpApplicationName, use quotation marks around the executable path in lpCommandLine, as shown in the following example: The following example demonstrates how to call this function.

The advantage of running separately is that a crash only terminates the single VDM; any other programs running in distinct VDMs continue to function normally.

The system uses the base priority level of all executable threads to determine which thread gets the next slice of CPU time. The  SetThreadPriority function enables setting the base priority level of a thread relative to the priority class of its process. For more information, see  Scheduling Priorities. The *_PRIORITY_CLASS values affect the CPU scheduling priority of the process. For processes that perform background work such as file I/O, network I/O, or data processing, it is not sufficient to adjust the CPU scheduling priority; even an idle CPU priority process can easily interfere with system responsiveness when it uses the disk and memory. Processes that perform background work should use the PROCESS_MODE_BACKGROUND_BEGIN and PROCESS_MODE_BACKGROUND_END values to adjust their resource scheduling priorities; processes that interact with the user should not use PROCESS_MODE_BACKGROUND_BEGIN. If a process is in background processing mode, the new threads it creates will also be in background processing mode. When a thread is in background processing mode, it should minimize sharing resources such as critical sections, heaps, and handles with other threads in the process, otherwise priority inversions can occur. If there are threads executing at high priority, a thread in background processing mode may not be scheduled promptly, but it will never be starved. Each  thread can enter background processing mode independently using SetThreadPriority. Do not call SetPriorityClass to enter background processing mode after a thread in the process has called SetThreadPriority to enter background processing mode. After a process ends background processing mode, it resets all threads in the process; however, it is not possible for the process to know which threads were already in background processing mode.

For example, a      file indexing application might set a lower default priority for the process that performs the indexing task. Memory priority helps to determine how long pages remain in the      working set of a process before they are trimmed. A process's      memory priority determines the default priority of the physical pages that are added to the process working set by      the threads of that process. When the memory manager trims the working set, it trims lower priority pages before      higher priority pages. This improves overall system performance because higher priority pages are less likely to      be trimmed from the working set and then trigger a page fault when they are accessed again. The following example shows how to call       SetProcessInformation with       ProcessMemoryPriority to set low memory priority as the default for the calling       process. ",

Keyboard and mouse events received by both threads are processed by the  thread specified by the idAttachTo parameter until the threads are detached by calling AttachThreadInput a second time and specifying FALSE for the fAttach parameter. This also allows threads to share their input states, so they can call the SetFocus function to set the keyboard focus to a window of a different thread. This also allows threads to get key-state information. The  AttachThreadInput function fails if either of the specified threads does not have a message queue. The system creates a thread's message queue when the thread makes its first call to one of the USER or GDI functions. The  AttachThreadInput function also fails if a journal record hook is installed. Journal record hooks attach all input queues together. Note that key state, which can be ascertained by calls to the  GetKeyState or  GetKeyboardState function, is reset after a call to  AttachThreadInput.

Note that CreateThread may succeed even if         lpStartAddress points to data, code, or is not accessible. If the start address is         invalid when the thread runs, an exception occurs, and the thread terminates. Thread termination due to a         invalid start address is handled as an error exit for the thread's process. This behavior is similar to the         asynchronous nature of CreateProcess, where the         process is created even if it refers to invalid or missing dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). ",
    "remarks": "The number of threads a process can create is limited by the available virtual memory. By default, every thread has one megabyte of stack space. Therefore, you can create at most 2,048 threads. If you reduce the default stack size, you can create more threads. However, your application will have better performance if you create one thread per processor and build queues of requests for which the application maintains the context information. A thread would process all requests in a queue before processing requests in the next queue. The new thread handle is created with the THREAD_ALL_ACCESS access right. If a security descriptor is not provided when the thread is created, a default security descriptor is constructed for the new thread using the primary token of the   process that is creating the thread. When a caller attempts to access the thread  with the OpenThread function, the effective token of the caller is evaluated against this  security descriptor to grant or deny access. The newly created thread  has full access rights to itself when calling the GetCurrentThread  function. Windows Server 2003:  The thread's access rights to itself are computed by evaluating the primary token of the process in which the thread was created  against the default security descriptor constructed for the thread. If the thread is created in a remote process, the primary token of the remote process is used. As a result, the newly created thread may have reduced access rights to itself when calling GetCurrentThread. Some access rights including THREAD_SET_THREAD_TOKEN and THREAD_GET_CONTEXT may not be present, leading to unexpected failures. For this reason, creating a thread while impersonating another user is not recommended. If the thread is created in a runnable state (that is, if the CREATE_SUSPENDED flag is not used), the thread can start running before CreateThread returns and, in particular, before  the caller receives the handle and identifier of the created thread. The thread execution begins at the function specified by the lpStartAddress parameter. If this function returns, the DWORD return value is used to terminate the thread in an implicit call to the  ExitThread function. Use the  GetExitCodeThread function to get the thread's return value. The thread is created with a thread priority of THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL. Use the  GetThreadPriority and  SetThreadPriority functions to get and set the priority value of a thread. When a thread terminates, the thread object attains a signaled state, satisfying any threads that were waiting on the object. The thread object remains in the system until the thread has terminated and all handles to it have been closed through a call to  CloseHandle. The  ExitProcess,  ExitThread,  CreateThread,  CreateRemoteThread functions, and a process that is starting (as the result of a call by  CreateProcess) are serialized between each other within a process. Only one of these events can happen in an address space at a time. This means that the following restrictions hold: A thread in an executable that calls the C run-time library (CRT) should use the _beginthreadex and _endthreadex functions for thread management rather than  CreateThread and  ExitThread; this requires the use of the multithreaded version of the CRT. If a thread created using CreateThread calls the CRT, the CRT may terminate the process in low-memory conditions.

    "remarks": "To help improve system performance, applications should use the SetThreadInformation function with ThreadMemoryPriority to lower the memory priority of threads that perform background operations or access files and data that are not expected to be accessed again soon. For example, an anti-malware application might lower the priority of threads involved in scanning files. Memory priority helps to determine how long pages remain in the working set of a process before they are trimmed. A thread's memory priority determines the minimum priority of the physical pages that are added to the process working set by that thread. When the memory manager trims the working set, it trims lower priority pages before higher priority pages. This improves overall system performance because higher priority pages are less likely to be trimmed from the working set and then trigger a page fault when they are accessed again. The following example shows how to call SetThreadInformation with ThreadMemoryPriority to set low memory priority on the current thread. ",

    "remarks": "Every thread has a base priority level determined by the thread's priority value and the priority class of its process. The system uses the base priority level of all executable threads to determine which thread gets the next slice of CPU time. Threads are scheduled in a round-robin fashion at each priority level, and only when there are no executable threads at a higher level does scheduling of threads at a lower level take place. The  SetThreadPriority function enables setting the base priority level of a thread relative to the priority class of its process. For example, specifying THREAD_PRIORITY_HIGHEST in a call to  SetThreadPriority for a thread of an IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS process sets the thread's base priority level to 6. For a table that shows the base priority levels for each combination of priority class and thread priority value, see  Scheduling Priorities. For IDLE_PRIORITY_CLASS, BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS, NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS, ABOVE_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS, and HIGH_PRIORITY_CLASS processes, the system dynamically boosts a thread's base priority level when events occur that are important to the thread. REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS processes do not receive dynamic boosts. All threads initially start at THREAD_PRIORITY_NORMAL. Use the  GetPriorityClass and  SetPriorityClass functions to get and set the priority class of a process. Use the  GetThreadPriority function to get the priority value of a thread. Use the priority class of a process to differentiate between applications that are time critical and those that have normal or below normal scheduling requirements. Use thread priority values to differentiate the relative priorities of the tasks of a process. For example, a thread that handles input for a window could have a higher priority level than a thread that performs intensive calculations for the CPU. When manipulating priorities, be very careful to ensure that a high-priority thread does not consume all of the available CPU time. A thread with a base priority level above 11 interferes with the normal operation of the operating system. Using REALTIME_PRIORITY_CLASS may cause disk caches to not flush, cause the mouse to stop responding, and so on. The THREAD_PRIORITY_* values affect the CPU scheduling priority of the thread. For threads that perform background work such as file I/O, network I/O, or data processing, it is not sufficient to adjust the CPU scheduling priority; even an idle CPU priority thread can easily interfere with system responsiveness when it uses the disk and memory. Threads that perform background work should use the THREAD_MODE_BACKGROUND_BEGIN and THREAD_MODE_BACKGROUND_END values to adjust their resource scheduling priorities; threads that interact with the user should not use THREAD_MODE_BACKGROUND_BEGIN. When a thread is in background processing mode, it should minimize sharing resources such as critical sections, heaps, and handles with other threads in the process, otherwise priority inversions can occur. If there are threads executing at high priority, a thread in background processing mode may not be scheduled promptly, but it will never be starved. Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista:  While the system is starting, the SetThreadPriority function returns a success return value but does not change thread priority  for applications that are started from the system Startup folder or listed in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run registry key. These applications run at reduced priority for a short time (approximately 60 seconds) to make the system more responsive to user actions during startup.

You should call  TerminateThread only if you know exactly what the target thread is doing, and you control all of the code that the target thread could possibly be running at the time of the termination. For example,  TerminateThread can result in the following problems: A thread cannot protect itself against  TerminateThread, other than by controlling access to its handles. The thread handle returned by the  CreateThread and  CreateProcess functions has THREAD_TERMINATE access, so any caller holding one of these handles can terminate your thread. If the target thread is the last thread of a process when this function is called, the thread's process is also terminated. The state of the thread object becomes signaled, releasing any other threads that had been waiting for the thread to terminate. The thread's termination status changes from STILL_ACTIVE to the value of the dwExitCode parameter. Terminating a thread does not necessarily remove the thread object from the system. A thread object is deleted when the last thread handle is closed. ",

PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PREFERRED_NODE   The lpValue parameter is a pointer to the node number of the preferred NUMA node for the new process. Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista:  This value is not supported until Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.   PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_UMS_THREAD   The lpValue parameter is a pointer to a UMS_CREATE_THREAD_ATTRIBUTES structure that specifies a user-mode scheduling (UMS) thread context and a UMS completion list to associate with the thread.  After the UMS thread is created, the system queues it to the specified completion list. The UMS thread runs only when an application's UMS scheduler retrieves the UMS thread from the completion list and selects it to run.  For more information, see User-Mode Scheduling. Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista:  This value is not supported until Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.   PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES   The lpValue parameter is a pointer to a SECURITY_CAPABILITIES structure that defines the security capabilities of an app container. If this attribute is set the new process will be created as an AppContainer process. Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista:  This value is not supported until  Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012.   PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PROTECTION_LEVEL   The lpValue parameter is a pointer to a DWORD value of PROTECTION_LEVEL_SAME. This specifies the protection level of the child process to be the same as the protection level of its parent process.   PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_CHILD_PROCESS_POLICY   The lpValue parameter is a pointer to a DWORD or DWORD64 value that specifies the child process policy. THe policy specifies whether to allow a child process to be created. For information on the possible values for the  DWORD or DWORD64 to which lpValue points, see Remarks.   PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_DESKTOP_APP_POLICY   This attribute is relevant only to win32 applications that have been converted to UWP packages by using the Desktop Bridge.  The lpValue parameter is a pointer to a DWORD value that specifies the desktop app policy. The policy specifies whether descendant processes should continue to run in the desktop environment. For information about the possible values for the DWORD to which lpValue points, see Remarks."

Suspending a thread causes the thread to stop executing user-mode (application) code. This function is primarily designed for use by debuggers. It is not intended to be used for thread synchronization. Calling  Wow64SuspendThread on a thread that owns a synchronization object, such as a mutex or critical section, can lead to a deadlock if the calling thread tries to obtain a synchronization object owned by a suspended thread. To avoid this situation, a thread within an application that is not a debugger should signal the other thread to suspend itself. The target thread must be designed to watch for this signal and respond appropriately. Each thread has a suspend count (with a maximum value of MAXIMUM_SUSPEND_COUNT). If the suspend count is greater than zero, the thread is suspended; otherwise, the thread is not suspended and is eligible for execution. Calling  Wow64SuspendThread causes the target thread's suspend count to be incremented. Attempting to increment past the maximum suspend count causes an error without incrementing the count. The  ResumeThread function decrements the suspend count of a suspended thread. This function is intended for 64-bit applications. It is not supported on 32-bit Windows; such calls fail and set the last error code to ERROR_INVALID_FUNCTION.

    "remarks": "After you associate a process with a job object using  AssignProcessToJobObject, the process is subject to the limits set for the job. To set limits for a job, use the  SetInformationJobObject function. If the job has a user-mode time limit, and the time limit has been exhausted,  AssignProcessToJobObject fails and the specified process is terminated. If the time limit would be exceeded by associating the process,  AssignProcessToJobObject still succeeds. However, the time limit violation will be reported. If the job has an active process limit, and the limit would be exceeded by associating this process,  AssignProcessToJobObject fails, and the specified process is terminated. Memory operations performed by a process associated with a job that has a memory limit are subject to the memory limit. Memory operations performed by the process before it was associated with the job are not examined by  AssignProcessToJobObject. If the process is already running and the job has security limitations,  AssignProcessToJobObject may fail. For example, if the primary token of the process contains the local administrators group, but the job object has the security limitation JOB_OBJECT_SECURITY_NO_ADMIN, the function fails. If the job has the security limitation JOB_OBJECT_SECURITY_ONLY_TOKEN, the process must be created suspended. To create a suspended process, call the  CreateProcess function with the CREATE_SUSPENDED flag. A process can be associated with more than one job in a hierarchy of nested jobs. For priority class, affinity, commit charge, per-process execution time limit, scheduling class limit, and working set minimum and maximum, the process inherits an effective limit which is the most restrictive limit of all the jobs in its parent job chain. For other resource limits, the process inherits limits from its immediate job in the hierarchy. Accounting information is added to the  immediate job and aggregated in each parent job in the job chain. By default, all child processes are associated with the immediate job and every job in the parent job chain. To create a child process that is not part of the same job chain, call the CreateProcess function with the CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB flag. The child process breaks away from every job in the job chain unless a job in the chain does not allow breakaway. In this case, the child process does not break away from that job or any job above it in the job chain. For more information, see Nested Jobs. Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows XP with SP3, Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2003:  A process can be associated only with a single job. A process inherits limits from the job it is associated with and adds its accounting information to the job. If a process is associated with a job, all child processes it creates are associated with that job by default. To create a child process that is not part of the same job, call the  CreateProcess function with the CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB flag. A process can be associated with more than one job starting in Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012. Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista:  If the process is being monitored by the Program Compatibility Assistant (PCA), it is placed into a compatibility job. Therefore, the process must be created using CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB before it can be placed in another job. Alternatively, you can embed an application manifest that specifies a User Account Control (UAC) level in your application and PCA will not add the process to the compatibility job. For more information, see Application Development Requirements for User Account Control Compatibility. If the job or any of its parent jobs in the job chain is terminating when AssignProcessToJob is called, the function fails. To compile an application that uses this function, define _WIN32_WINNT as 0x0500 or later. For more information, see  Using the Windows Headers. ",

    "remarks": "The CloseThreadpoolCleanupGroupMembers function simplifies cleanup of thread pool callback objects by releasing, in a single operation, all work objects, wait objects, and timer objects that are members of the cleanup group. An object becomes a member of a cleanup group when the object is created with the threadpool callback environment that was specified when the cleanup group was created. For more information, see CreateThreadpoolCleanupGroup. The CloseThreadpoolCleanupGroupMembers function blocks until all currently executing callback functions finish. If fCancelPendingCallbacks is TRUE, outstanding callbacks are canceled; otherwise, the function blocks until all outstanding callbacks also finish.  After the CloseThreadpoolCleanupGroupMembers function returns, an application should not use any object that was a member of the cleanup group at the time CloseThreadpoolCleanupGroupMembers was called.  Also, an application should not release any of the objects individually by calling a function such as CloseThreadpoolWork, because the objects have already been released. The CloseThreadpoolCleanupGroupMembers function does not close the cleanup group itself. Instead, the cleanup group persists until the CloseThreadpoolCleanupGroup function is called. Also, closing a cleanup group does not affect the associated threadpool callback environment. The callback environment persists until it is destroyed by calling DestroyThreadpoolEnvironment. As long as a cleanup group persists, new objects created with the cleanup group's associated threadpool callback environment are added to the cleanup group. This allows an application to reuse the cleanup group. However, it can lead to errors if the application does not synchronize code that calls CloseThreadpoolCleanupGroupMembers with code that creates new objects. For example, suppose a thread creates two threadpool work objects, Work1 and Work2. Another thread calls CloseThreadpoolCleanupGroupMembers. Depending on when the threads run, any of the following might occur: To simply wait for or cancel pending work items without releasing them, use one of the threadpool callback functions: WaitForThreadpoolIoCallbacks, WaitForThreadpoolTimerCallbacks, WaitForThreadpoolWaitCallbacks, or WaitForThreadpoolWorkCallbacks. To compile an application that uses this function, define _WIN32_WINNT as 0x0600 or higher. For an example, see Using the Thread Pool Functions. ",

The callback routine is executed by a worker thread when the object's state becomes signaled or the time-out interval elapses. If dwFlags is not WT_EXECUTEONLYONCE, the timer is reset every time the event is signaled or the time-out interval elapses. When the wait is completed, you must call the  UnregisterWait or  UnregisterWaitEx function to cancel the wait operation. (Even wait operations that use WT_EXECUTEONLYONCE must be canceled.) Do not make a blocking call to either of these functions from within the callback function. Note that you should not pulse an event object passed to  RegisterWaitForSingleObject, because the wait thread might not detect that the event is signaled before it is reset. You should not register an object that remains signaled (such as a manual reset event or terminated process) unless you set the WT_EXECUTEONLYONCE or WT_EXECUTEINWAITTHREAD flag. For other flags,  the callback function might be called too many times before the event is reset. The function modifies the state of some types of synchronization objects. Modification occurs only for the object whose signaled state caused the wait condition to be satisfied. For example, the count of a semaphore object is decreased by one. The  RegisterWaitForSingleObject function can wait for the following objects: For more information, see  Synchronization Objects. By default, the thread pool has a maximum of 500 threads.

Otherwise, the timer is reset every time the wait operation completes until the wait operation is canceled.   WT_TRANSFER_IMPERSONATION 0x00000100   Callback functions will use the current access token, whether it is a process or impersonation token. If this flag is not specified, callback functions execute only with the process token. Windows XP:  This flag is not supported until Windows XP with SP2 and Windows Server 2003."

    "remarks": "You cannot make a blocking call to  UnregisterWaitEx from within a callback function for the same wait operation. Otherwise, the callback will be waiting for itself to finish. In general, a blocking call to UnregisterWaitEx creates a dependency between the current thread and the callback, so to make a blocking unregister call on another wait operation, you must ensure that the callback functions do not depend on one another and that the second wait operation does not also perform a blocking unregister call on the first operation. Be careful when making a blocking UnregisterWaitEx call on a persistent thread. If the wait operation being unregistered was created with   WT_EXECUTEINPERSISTENTTHREAD, a deadlock may occur. After making non-blocking call to UnregisterWaitEx, no new callback functions associated with WaitHandle can be queued. However, there may be pending callback functions already queued to worker threads. Under some conditions, the function will fail with ERROR_IO_PENDING if CompletionEvent is NULL. This indicates that there are outstanding callback functions. Those callbacks either will execute or are in the middle of executing. If CompletionEvent is a handle to an event provided by the caller, it is possible for the function to succeed, fail with ERROR_IO_PENDING, or fail with a different error code. If the function succeeds, or if the function fails with ERROR_IO_PENDING, the caller should always wait until the event is signaled to close the event. If the function fails with a different error code, it is not necessary to wait until the event is signaled to close the event. Windows XP:  If CompletionEvent is a handle to an event provided by the caller and the function fails with  ERROR_IO_PENDING,  the caller should wait until the event is signaled to close the event. This behavior changed starting with Windows Vista. To compile an application that uses this function, define _WIN32_WINNT as 0x0500 or later. For more information, see  Using the Windows Headers. ",

It can commit a page that is already committed. This means you can commit a range of pages, regardless of       whether they have already been committed, and the function will not fail. You can use VirtualAllocExNuma to reserve a       block of pages and then make additional calls to       VirtualAllocExNuma to commit individual pages from       the reserved block. This enables a process to reserve a range of its virtual address space without consuming       physical storage until it is needed. If the lpAddress parameter is not NULL, the function uses       the lpAddress and dwSize parameters to compute the region of       pages to be allocated. The current state of the entire range of pages must be compatible with the type of       allocation specified by the flAllocationType parameter. Otherwise, the function fails       and none of the pages is allocated. This compatibility requirement does not preclude committing an already       committed page; see the preceding list. Because VirtualAllocExNuma does not allocate any       physical pages, it will succeed whether or not the pages are available on that node or elsewhere in the system.       The physical pages are allocated on demand. If the preferred node runs out of pages, the memory manager will use       pages from other nodes. If the memory is paged out, the same process is used when it is brought back in. To execute dynamically generated code, use       VirtualAllocExNuma to allocate memory and the       VirtualProtectEx function to grant       PAGE_EXECUTE access. The VirtualAllocExNuma function can be used to       reserve an       Address Windowing Extensions       (AWE) region of memory within the virtual address space of a specified process. This region of memory can then be       used to map physical pages into and out of virtual memory as required by the application. The       MEM_PHYSICAL and MEM_RESERVE values must be set in the       AllocationType parameter. The MEM_COMMIT value must not be       set. The page protection must be set to PAGE_READWRITE. The VirtualFreeEx function can decommit a committed       page, releasing the page's storage, or it can simultaneously decommit and release a committed page. It can also       release a reserved page, making it a free page. To compile an application that uses this function, define _WIN32_WINNT as 0x0600       or later.

Actual physical pages are not allocated unless/until the virtual addresses are           actually accessed. To reserve and commit pages in one step, call the function with           MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE. Attempting to commit a specific address range by specifying MEM_COMMIT without           MEM_RESERVE and a non-NULL lpAddress fails unless the entire range has already been reserved. The resulting           error code is ERROR_INVALID_ADDRESS. An attempt to commit a page that is already committed does not cause the function to fail. This means that           you can commit pages without first determining the current commitment state of each page.   MEM_RESERVE 0x00002000   Reserves a range of the process's virtual address space without allocating any actual physical storage in           memory or in the paging file on disk. You commit reserved pages by calling the function again with MEM_COMMIT. To           reserve and commit pages in one step, call the function with           MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE. Other memory allocation functions, such as malloc and           LocalAlloc, cannot use reserved memory until it has           been released.   MEM_RESET 0x00080000   Indicates that data in the memory range specified by lpAddress and           dwSize is no longer of interest. The pages should not be read from or written to           the paging file. However, the memory block will be used again later, so it should not be decommitted. This           value cannot be used with any other value. Using this value does not guarantee that the range operated on with MEM_RESET           will contain zeros. If you want the range to contain zeros, decommit the memory and then recommit it. When you use MEM_RESET, the function ignores the value of           fProtect. However, you must still set fProtect to a valid           protection value, such as PAGE_NOACCESS. The function returns an error if you use MEM_RESET and the range of memory is           mapped to a file. A shared view is only acceptable if it is mapped to a paging file.   MEM_RESET_UNDO 0x1000000   MEM_RESET_UNDO should only be called on an address range to which           MEM_RESET was successfully applied earlier. It indicates that the data in the           specified memory range specified by lpAddress and dwSize           is of interest to the caller and attempts to reverse the effects of MEM_RESET. If           the function succeeds, that means all data in the specified address range is intact. If the function fails,           at least some of the data in the address range has been replaced with zeroes. This value cannot be used with any other value. If MEM_RESET_UNDO is called on an           address range which was not MEM_RESET earlier, the behavior is undefined. When you           specify MEM_RESET, the           VirtualAllocExNuma function ignores the value of           flProtect. However, you must still set flProtect to a           valid protection value, such as PAGE_NOACCESS. Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista:  The MEM_RESET_UNDO flag is not supported until Windows 8 and            Windows Server 2012.     This parameter can also specify the following values as indicated.  ValueMeaning  MEM_LARGE_PAGES 0x20000000   Allocates memory using large page support. The size and alignment must be a multiple of the large-page minimum. To obtain this value, use the           GetLargePageMinimum function. If you specify this value, you must also specify MEM_RESERVE and MEM_COMMIT.   MEM_PHYSICAL 0x00400000   Reserves an address range that can be used to map           Address Windowing Extensions (AWE)           pages. This value must be used with MEM_RESERVE and no other values.   MEM_TOP_DOWN 0x00100000   Allocates memory at the highest possible address."
