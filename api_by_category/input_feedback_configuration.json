    "remarks": "This function is intended for use with applications that allow the user to customize the environment. A keyboard layout name should be derived from the hexadecimal value of the language identifier corresponding to the layout. For example, U.S. English has a language identifier of 0x0409, so the primary U.S. English layout is named \"00000409\". Variants of U.S. English layout, such as the Dvorak layout, are named \"00010409\", \"00020409\" and so on. For a list of the primary language identifiers and sublanguage identifiers that make up a language identifier, see the MAKELANGID macro. There is a difference between the High Contrast color scheme and the High Contrast Mode. The High Contrast color scheme changes the system colors to colors that have obvious contrast; you switch to this color scheme by using the Display Options in the control panel. The High Contrast Mode, which uses SPI_GETHIGHCONTRAST and SPI_SETHIGHCONTRAST, advises applications to modify their appearance for visually-impaired users. It involves such things as audible warning to users and customized color scheme (using the Accessibility Options in the control panel). For more information, see HIGHCONTRAST. For more information on general accessibility features, see Accessibility. During the time that the primary button is held down to activate the Mouse ClickLock feature, the user can move the mouse. After the primary button is locked down, releasing the primary button does not result in a WM_LBUTTONUP message. Thus, it will appear to an application that the primary button is still down. Any subsequent button message releases the primary button, sending a WM_LBUTTONUP message to the application, thus the button can be unlocked programmatically or through the user clicking any button. The following example uses SystemParametersInfo to double the mouse speed. ",

        "description": "Type: UINT The system-wide parameter to be retrieved or set. The possible values are organized in the following tables of related parameters:                                                           Accessibility parameters Desktop parameters Icon parameters Input parameters Menu parameters Power parameters Screen saver parameters Time-out parameters UI effect parameters Window parameters  The following are the accessibility parameters.  Accessibility parameterMeaning  SPI_GETACCESSTIMEOUT 0x003C   Retrieves information about the time-out period associated with the accessibility features. The pvParam parameter must point to an ACCESSTIMEOUT structure that receives the information. Set the cbSize member of this structure and the uiParam parameter to sizeof(ACCESSTIMEOUT).   SPI_GETAUDIODESCRIPTION 0x0074   Determines whether audio descriptions are enabled or disabled. The pvParam parameter is a pointer to an AUDIODESCRIPTION structure. Set the cbSize member of this structure and the uiParam parameter to sizeof(AUDIODESCRIPTION). While it is possible for users who have visual impairments to hear the audio in video content, there is a lot of action in video that does not have corresponding audio. Specific audio description of what is happening in a video helps these users understand the content better. This flag enables you to determine whether audio descriptions have been enabled and in which language. Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP/2000:  This parameter is not supported.   SPI_GETCLIENTAREAANIMATION 0x1042   Determines whether animations are enabled or disabled. The pvParam parameter must point to a BOOL variable that receives TRUE if animations are enabled, or FALSE otherwise.

For a general discussion, see Remarks.   SPI_GETLOGICALDPIOVERRIDE 0x009E   Retrieves a value that determines whether Windows 8 is displaying apps using the default scaling plateau for the hardware or going to the next higher plateau. This value is based on the current \"Make everything on your screen bigger\" setting, found in the Ease of Access section of PC settings: 1 is on, 0 is off. Apps can provide text and image resources for each of several scaling plateaus: 100%, 140%, and 180%. Providing separate resources optimized for a particular scale avoids distortion due to resizing. Windows 8 determines the appropriate scaling plateau based on a number of factors, including screen size and pixel density. When \"Make everything on your screen bigger\" is selected (SPI_GETLOGICALDPIOVERRIDE returns a value of 1), Windows uses resources from the next higher plateau. For example, in the case of hardware that Windows determines should use a scale of SCALE_100_PERCENT, this override causes Windows to use the SCALE_140_PERCENT scale value, assuming that it does not violate other constraints. Note  You should not use this value. It might be altered or unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows. Instead, use the GetScaleFactorForDevice function or the DisplayProperties class to retrieve the preferred scaling factor. Desktop applications should use desktop logical DPI rather than scale factor. Desktop logical DPI can be retrieved through the GetDeviceCaps function.     SPI_GETMESSAGEDURATION 0x2016   Retrieves the time that notification pop-ups should be displayed, in seconds. The pvParam parameter must point to a ULONG that receives the message duration.
