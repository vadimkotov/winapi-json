FtpFindFirstFile is similar to the FindFirstFile function. Note, however, that only one  FtpFindFirstFile can occur at a time within a given FTP session. The enumerations, therefore, are correlated with the FTP session handle. This is because the FTP protocol allows only a single directory enumeration per session. After calling  FtpFindFirstFile and until calling  InternetCloseHandle, the application cannot call  FtpFindFirstFile again on the given FTP session handle. If a call is made to  FtpFindFirstFile on that handle, the function  fails with  ERROR_FTP_TRANSFER_IN_PROGRESS. After the calling application has finished using the  HINTERNET handle returned by  FtpFindFirstFile, it must be closed using the  InternetCloseHandle function. After beginning a directory enumeration with  FtpFindFirstFile, the  InternetFindNextFile function can be used to continue the enumeration. Because the FTP protocol provides no standard means of enumerating, some of the common information about files, such as file creation date and time, is not always available or correct. When this happens,  FtpFindFirstFile and  InternetFindNextFile fill in unavailable information with a best guess based on available information. For example, creation and last access dates are often  the same as the file's modification date. The application cannot call  FtpFindFirstFile between calls to  FtpOpenFile and  InternetCloseHandle.

    "remarks": "The HttpOpenRequest function creates a new HTTP request handle and stores the specified parameters in that handle. An HTTP request handle holds a request to be sent to an HTTP server and contains all RFC822/MIME/HTTP headers to be sent as part of the request. If a verb other than \"GET\" or \"POST\" is specified, HttpOpenRequest automatically sets INTERNET_FLAG_NO_CACHE_WRITE and INTERNET_FLAG_RELOAD for the request. With Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 and later, if  lpszVerb is set to \"HEAD\", the Content-Length header is ignored on responses from HTTP/1.1 servers. On Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and later, the lpszVersion parameter is overridden by Internet Explorer settings.  The EnableHttp1_1 is a registry value under HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\InternetExplorer\\AdvacnedOptions\\HTTP\\GENABLE controlled by Internet Options set in Internet Explorer for the system.  The EnableHttp1_1 value defaults to 1. The HttpOpenRequest function upgrades any HTTP version less than 1.1 to HTTP version 1.1 if EnableHttp1_1 is set to 1. After the calling application has finished using the  HINTERNET handle returned by  HttpOpenRequest, it must be closed using the  InternetCloseHandle function. Note   When a request is sent in asynchronous mode (the dwFlags parameter of InternetOpen specifies INTERNET_FLAG_ASYNC), and the dwContext parameter is zero (INTERNET_NO_CALLBACK), the callback function set with InternetSetStatusCallback on the request handle will not be invoked, however, the call will still be performed in asynchronous mode.

Client applications that must canonicalize the entire URL should use either  CoInternetParseUrl (with the action PARSE_CANONICALIZE and the flag URL_ESCAPE_UNSAFE) or  UrlCanonicalize. InternetCanonicalizeUrl always encodes by default, even if the ICU_DECODE flag has been specified. To decode without reencoding, use ICU_DECODE | ICU_NO_ENCODE. If the ICU_DECODE flag is used without ICU_NO_ENCODE, the URL is decoded before being parsed; unsafe characters are then  re-encoded after parsing. This function  handles arbitrary protocol schemes, but to do so it must make inferences from the unsafe character set. Applications that call  InternetCanonicalizeUrl when using  Internet Explorer 3.0 (or when setting the ICU_ENCODE_PERCENT flag for Internet Explorer 5 and later) should track the usage of this function on a particular URL. If unsafe characters in a URL have been converted to escape sequences, using  InternetCanonicalizeUrl again on the URL (with no flags)  causes the escape sequences to be converted to another escape sequence. For example, a blank space in a URL would be converted to the escape sequence %20. Calling  InternetCanonicalizeUrl again on the URL would cause the escape sequence %20 to be converted to the escape sequence %2520, because the % sign is an unsafe character that is reserved for escape sequences and is replaced by the function with the escape sequence %25.

    "remarks": "InternetReadFile operates much like the base  ReadFile function, with a few exceptions. Typically,  InternetReadFile retrieves data from an  HINTERNET handle as a sequential stream of bytes. The amount of data to be read for each call to  InternetReadFile is specified by the  dwNumberOfBytesToRead parameter and the data is returned in the  lpBuffer parameter. A normal read retrieves the specified  dwNumberOfBytesToRead for each call to  InternetReadFile until the end of the file is reached. To ensure all data is retrieved, an application must continue to call the  InternetReadFile function until the function returns TRUE and the  lpdwNumberOfBytesRead parameter equals zero. This is especially important if the requested data is written to the cache, because otherwise the cache will not be properly updated and the file downloaded will not be committed to the cache. Note that caching happens automatically unless the original request to open the data stream set the INTERNET_FLAG_NO_CACHE_WRITE flag. When an application retrieves a handle using  InternetOpenUrl, WinINet attempts to make all data look like a file download, in an effort to make reading from the Internet easier for the application. For some types of information, such as FTP file directory listings, it converts the data to be returned by   InternetReadFile to an HTML stream. It does this on a line-by-line basis. For example, it can convert an FTP directory listing to a line of HTML and return this HTML to the application. WinINet attempts to write the HTML to the  lpBuffer buffer a line at a time. If the application's buffer is too small to fit at least one line of generated HTML, the error code  ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER is returned as an indication to the application that it needs a larger buffer. Also, converted lines might not completely fill the buffer, so  InternetReadFile can return with less data in  lpBuffer than requested. Subsequent reads will retrieve all the converted HTML. The application must again check that all data is retrieved as described previously. Like all other aspects of the WinINet API, this function cannot be safely called from within DllMain or the constructors and destructors of global objects. When running asynchronously, if a call to InternetReadFile does not result in a completed transaction, it will return FALSE and a subsequent call to GetLastError will return ERROR_IO_PENDING. When the transaction is completed the InternetStatusCallback specified in a previous call to   InternetSetStatusCallback will be called with INTERNET_STATUS_REQUEST_COMPLETE. ",

    "remarks": "These privacy settings for the Internet zone are found on the Privacy tab of the Internet Options dialog box. Setting the privacy options for the URLZONE_INTERNET involves setting the privacy templates for both PrivacyTypes. The slider on the Privacy Menu in Internet Options only moves if privacy is set for both PrivacyTypes. Custom privacy preferences for a given URLZONE and PrivacyType can be set through the pszPreference parameter. The pszPreference parameter can contain a series of rules separated by white space describing the privacy preferences. It is important to note that the rules themselves cannot contain white space. The pszPreference has the following structure where there can be multiple logical rules: <signature> <logical-rule> <special-rule>. Currently, the signature must be set to IE6-P3PSettings/V1:. Logical rules have the following format: /<expression>=<decision>/. An expression is a Boolean statement composed of compact policy tokens using the operators & (logical AND) and ! (logical NOT). The compact policy token is case-sensitive. (For more information on Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) privacy policies and compact policy tokens, see the W3C: Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) Project  specification.) The decision is a single lowercase character that defines the action to take on the cookie whose compact policy contains the specified token(s). The following table lists valid decision characters.  Logical rules are evaluated in the order they are listed. The first logical-rule to be matched, if any, determines the cookie action. An empty expression is also allowed. If an expression is empty, the left side evaluates to true. This form of a logical-rule can be used at the end of a set of rules to catch all situations that did not fall into the other categories. The following examples show valid logical rules. Special rules are specified using the nopolicy, session, and always symbols. The nopolicy symbol is used to specify the action to taken when there is no compact policy. For example nopolicy=d specifies to downgrade all cookies without a compact policy to session cookies. The session symbol is used to specify the action to take on session cookies and can only be set to a. When session=a is specified, all session cookies are accepted regardless of the content of the compact policy. If this rule is not specified, session cookies are subject to the same rules as persistent cookies. Finally, the always symbol is used to specify to perform the same action for everything. For example, always=d specifies to deny all cookies regardless of the existence of a compact policy. Note that always=d is equivalent to /=d/. The following example shows a privacy preferences string that specifies to accept cookies for which the compact policy contains a FIN/CONi token pair, reject cookies with compact policies containing FIN/CON, FIN/CONo, FIN/CONa and GOV/PUB token pairs or a TEL token, and to prompt the user when a cookie's compact policy contains the UNR token. It also specifies to downgrade cookies without a compact policy to session cookies and to accept all cookies that do not match one of the given rules. Note that the first rule that evaluates to true determines the cookie action. Like all other aspects of the WinINet API, this function cannot be safely called from within DllMain or the constructors and destructors of global objects. ",
