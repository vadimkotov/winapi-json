    "remarks": "When a service is started, its  ServiceMain function should immediately call the  RegisterServiceCtrlHandler function to specify a  Handler function to process control requests. The control dispatcher in the main thread of a service process invokes the control handler function for the specified service whenever it receives a control request from the service control manager. After processing the control request, the control handler must call the  SetServiceStatus function if the service state changes to report its new status to the service control manager. The control handler function is intended to receive notification and return immediately. The callback function should save its parameters and create other threads to perform additional work. (Your application must ensure that such threads have exited before stopping the service.) In particular, a control handler should avoid  operations that might block, such as taking a lock, because this could result  in  a deadlock or cause the system to stop responding. When the service control manager sends a control code to a service, it waits for the handler function to return before sending additional control codes to other services. The control handler should return as quickly as possible; if it does not return within 30 seconds, the SCM  returns an error. If a service must do lengthy processing when the service is executing the control handler, it should create a secondary thread to perform the lengthy processing, and then return from the control handler. This prevents the service from tying up the control dispatcher and blocking other services from receiving control codes. The SERVICE_CONTROL_SHUTDOWN control code should only be processed by services that must absolutely clean up during shutdown, because there is a limited time (about 20 seconds) available for service shutdown. After this time expires, system shutdown proceeds regardless of whether service shutdown is complete. Note that if the system is left in the shutdown state (not restarted or powered down), the service continues to run.   If your service registers to accept SERVICE_CONTROL_SHUTDOWN, it must handle the control code and stop  in a timely fashion. Otherwise, the service can increase the time required to shut down the system, because the system must wait for the full amount of time allowed for service shutdown before system shutdown can proceed. If the service requires more time to clean up, it should send STOP_PENDING status messages, along with a wait hint, so the service controller knows how long to wait before reporting to the system that service shutdown is complete. However, to prevent a service from stopping shutdown, there is a limit to how long the service controller will wait. If the service is being shut down through the Services snap-in, the limit is 125 seconds. If the operating system is rebooting, the time limit is specified in the WaitToKillServiceTimeout value of the following registry key:  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control Services can also use the SetConsoleCtrlHandler function to receive shutdown notification. This notification is received when the running applications are shutting down, which occurs before services are shut down. For an example, see  Writing a Control Handler Function. ",

    "remarks": "A service program can start one or more services. A service process has a  SERVICE_TABLE_ENTRY structure for each service that it can start. The structure specifies the service name and a pointer to the  ServiceMain function for that service. When the service control manager receives a request to start a service, it starts the service process (if it is not already running). The main thread of the service process calls the  StartServiceCtrlDispatcher function with a pointer to an array of  SERVICE_TABLE_ENTRY structures. Then the service control manager sends a start request to the service control dispatcher for this service process. The service control dispatcher creates a new thread to execute the  ServiceMain function of the service being started. The  ServiceMain function should immediately call the  RegisterServiceCtrlHandlerEx function to specify a  HandlerEx function to handle control requests. Next, it should call the  SetServiceStatus function to send status information to the service control manager. After these calls, the function should complete the initialization of the service. Do not attempt to start another service in the  ServiceMain function. The Service Control Manager (SCM) waits until the service reports a status of SERVICE_RUNNING. It is recommended that the service reports this status as quickly as possible, as other components in the system that require interaction with SCM will be blocked during this time. Some functions  may require interaction with the SCM either directly or indirectly. The SCM locks the service control database during initialization, so if a service attempts to call StartService during initialization, the call will block. When the service reports to the SCM that it has successfully started, it can call StartService. If the service requires another service to be running, the service should set the required dependencies. Furthermore, you should not call any  system functions during service initialization. The service code should call system functions only after it reports a status of SERVICE_RUNNING. The  ServiceMain function should create a global event, call the  RegisterWaitForSingleObject function on this event, and exit. This will terminate the thread that is running the  ServiceMain function, but will not terminate the service. When the service is stopping, the service control handler should call SetServiceStatus with SERVICE_STOP_PENDING and signal this event. A thread from the thread pool will execute the wait callback function; this function should perform clean-up tasks, including closing the global event, and call  SetServiceStatus with SERVICE_STOPPED. After the service has stopped, you should not execute any additional service code because  you can introduce a race condition if the service receives a start control and ServiceMain is called again. Note that this problem is more likely to occur when multiple services share a process. For an example, see  Writing a ServiceMain Function. ",

    "remarks": "A  ServiceMain function first calls the  RegisterServiceCtrlHandlerEx function to get the service's SERVICE_STATUS_HANDLE. Then it immediately calls the  SetServiceStatus function to notify the service control manager that its status is SERVICE_START_PENDING. During initialization, the service can provide updated status to indicate that it is making progress but it needs more time. A common bug is for the service to have the main thread perform the initialization while a separate thread continues to call  SetServiceStatus to prevent the service control manager from marking it as hung. However, if the main thread hangs, then the service start ends up in an infinite loop because the worker thread continues to report that the main thread is making progress. After processing a control request, the service's  Handler function must call  SetServiceStatus if the service status changes to report its new status to the service control manager. It is only necessary to do so when the service is changing state, such as when it is processing stop or shutdown controls. A service can also use this function at any time from any thread of the service to notify the service control manager of state changes, such as when the service must stop due to a recoverable error. A service can call this function only after it has called  RegisterServiceCtrlHandlerEx to get a service status handle. If a service calls  SetServiceStatus with the dwCurrentState member set to SERVICE_STOPPED and the dwWin32ExitCode member set to a nonzero value, the following entry is written into the System event log: The following are best practices when calling this function: For an example, see  Writing a ServiceMain Function.

    "remarks": "When the service control manager starts a service process, it waits for the process to call the  StartServiceCtrlDispatcher function. The main thread of a service process should make this call as soon as possible after it starts up (within 30 seconds). If  StartServiceCtrlDispatcher succeeds, it connects the calling thread to the service control manager and does not return until all running services in the process have entered the SERVICE_STOPPED state. The service control manager uses this connection to send control and service start requests to the main thread of the service process. The main thread acts as a dispatcher by invoking the appropriate  HandlerEx function to handle control requests, or by creating a new thread to execute the appropriate  ServiceMain function when a new service is started. The lpServiceTable parameter contains an entry for each service that can run in the calling process. Each entry specifies the  ServiceMain function for that service. For SERVICE_WIN32_SHARE_PROCESS services, each entry must contain the name of a service. This name is the service name that was specified by the  CreateService function when the service was installed. For SERVICE_WIN32_OWN_PROCESS services, the service name in the table entry is ignored. If a service runs in its own process, the main thread of the service process should immediately call  StartServiceCtrlDispatcher. All initialization tasks are done in the service's  ServiceMain function when the service is started. If multiple services share a process and some common process-wide initialization needs to be done before any  ServiceMain function is called, the main thread can do the work before calling  StartServiceCtrlDispatcher, as long as it takes less than 30 seconds. Otherwise, another thread must be created to do the process-wide initialization, while the main thread calls  StartServiceCtrlDispatcher and becomes the service control dispatcher. Any service-specific initialization should still be done in the individual service main functions. Services should not attempt to display a user interface directly.

When the service status changes, the system invokes the specified callback function as an asynchronous procedure call (APC) queued to the calling thread. The calling thread must enter an alertable wait (for example, by calling the SleepEx function) to receive notification. For more information, see Asynchronous Procedure Calls. If the service is already in any of the requested states when NotifyServiceStatusChange is called, the callback function is queued immediately. If the service state has not changed by the next time the function is called with the same service and state, the callback function is not queued immediately; the callback function is queued the next time the service enters the requested state. The NotifyServiceStatusChange function calls the OpenThread function on the calling thread with the THREAD_SET_CONTEXT access right. If the calling thread does not have this access right, NotifyServiceStatusChange fails. If the calling thread is impersonating another user, it may not have sufficient permission to set context. It is more efficient to call NotifyServiceStatusChange from a thread that performs a wait than to create an additional thread. After the callback function is invoked, the caller must call NotifyServiceStatusChange to receive additional notifications. Note that certain functions in the Windows API, including NotifyServiceStatusChange and other SCM functions,  use remote procedure calls (RPC); these functions might perform an alertable wait operation, so they are not safe to call from within the callback function. Instead, the callback function should save the notification parameters and perform any additional work outside the callback. To cancel outstanding notifications, close the service handle using the CloseServiceHandle function. After CloseServiceHandle succeeds, no more notification APCs will be queued. If the calling  thread exits without closing the service handle or waiting until the APC  is generated, a memory leak can occur. ",

When a service is started, the Service Control Manager (SCM) spawns the service process, if necessary.

The  StartService function does not wait for the first status update from the new service, because it can take a while. Instead, it returns when the SCM receives notification from the service control dispatcher that the  ServiceMain thread for this service was created successfully. The SCM sets the following default status values before returning from  StartService: The calling process can determine if the new service has finished its initialization by calling the  QueryServiceStatus function periodically to query the service's status. A service cannot call  StartService during initialization. The reason is that the SCM  locks the service control database during initialization, so a call to  StartService will block. After the service reports to the SCM that it has successfully started, it can call  StartService. As with   ControlService, StartService will block for 30 seconds if any service is busy handling a control code. If the busy service still has not returned from its handler function when the timeout expires,  StartService fails with ERROR_SERVICE_REQUEST_TIMEOUT. This is because the SCM processes only one service control notification at a time. For an example, see  Starting a Service. ",

Because of the severity of this issue, processes are no longer allowed to lock the database. For compatibility with older applications, the LockServiceDatabase function returns a lock but has no other effect. Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP: Acquiring the SCM database lock prevents the SCM from starting a service until the lock is released. For example, a program that must configure several related services before any of them starts could call  LockServiceDatabase before configuring the first service. Alternatively, it could ensure that none of the services are started until the configuration has been completed. A call to the  StartService function to start a service in a locked database fails. No other SCM functions are affected by a lock. The lock is held until the SC_LOCK handle is specified in a subsequent call to the  UnlockServiceDatabase function. If a process that owns a lock terminates, the SCM automatically cleans up and releases ownership of the lock. Failing to release the lock can cause system problems. A process that acquires  the lock should release it as soon as possible. ",
