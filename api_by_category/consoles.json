Setting the output modes of one screen buffer does not affect the output modes of other screen buffers. The ENABLE_LINE_INPUT and ENABLE_ECHO_INPUT modes only affect processes that use ReadFile or  ReadConsole to read from the console's input buffer. Similarly, the ENABLE_PROCESSED_INPUT mode primarily affects ReadFile and  ReadConsole users, except that it also determines whether CTRL+C input is reported in the input buffer (to be read by the  ReadConsoleInput function) or is passed to a function defined by the application. The ENABLE_WINDOW_INPUT and ENABLE_MOUSE_INPUT modes determine whether user interactions involving window resizing and mouse actions are reported in the input buffer or discarded. These events can be read by  ReadConsoleInput, but they are always filtered by ReadFile and  ReadConsole. The ENABLE_PROCESSED_OUTPUT and ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT modes only affect processes using ReadFile or  ReadConsole and WriteFile or  WriteConsole. To change a console's I/O modes, call  SetConsoleMode function. For an example, see  Reading Input Buffer Events. ",

ValueMeaning  ENABLE_ECHO_INPUT 0x0004   Characters read by the ReadFile or  ReadConsole function are written to the active screen buffer as they are read. This mode can be used only if the ENABLE_LINE_INPUT mode is also enabled.   ENABLE_INSERT_MODE 0x0020   When enabled, text entered in a console window will be inserted at the current cursor location and all text following that location will not be overwritten. When disabled, all following text will be overwritten.   ENABLE_LINE_INPUT 0x0002   The  ReadFile or  ReadConsole function returns only when a carriage return character is read. If this mode is disabled, the functions return when one or more characters are available.   ENABLE_MOUSE_INPUT 0x0010   If the mouse pointer is within the borders of the console window and the window has the keyboard focus, mouse events generated by mouse movement and button presses are placed in the input buffer. These events are discarded by  ReadFile or  ReadConsole, even when this mode is enabled.   ENABLE_PROCESSED_INPUT 0x0001   CTRL+C is processed by the system and is not placed in the input buffer. If the input buffer is being read by  ReadFile or  ReadConsole, other control keys are processed by the system and are not returned in the ReadFile or  ReadConsole buffer. If the ENABLE_LINE_INPUT mode is also enabled, backspace, carriage return, and line feed characters are handled by the system.    ENABLE_QUICK_EDIT_MODE 0x0040   This flag enables the user to use the mouse to select and edit text.  To enable this mode, use ENABLE_QUICK_EDIT_MODE | ENABLE_EXTENDED_FLAGS. To disable this mode, use ENABLE_EXTENDED_FLAGS without this flag.   ENABLE_WINDOW_INPUT 0x0008   User interactions that change the size of the console screen buffer are reported in the console's input buffer. Information about these events can be read from the input buffer by applications using the  ReadConsoleInput function, but not by those using ReadFile or  ReadConsole.   ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_INPUT 0x0200   Setting this flag directs the Virtual Terminal processing engine to convert user input received by the console window into Console Virtual Terminal Sequences that can be retrieved by a supporting application through WriteFile or  WriteConsole functions. The typical usage of this flag is intended in conjunction with ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING on the output handle to connect to an application that communicates exclusively via virtual terminal sequences.     If the hConsoleHandle parameter is a screen buffer handle, the mode can be one or more of the following values. When a screen buffer is created, both output modes are enabled by default.  ValueMeaning  ENABLE_PROCESSED_OUTPUT 0x0001   Characters written by the  WriteFile or  WriteConsole function or echoed by the  ReadFile or  ReadConsole function are parsed for ASCII control sequences, and the correct action is performed. Backspace, tab, bell, carriage return, and line feed characters are processed.   ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT 0x0002   When writing with WriteFile or  WriteConsole or echoing with ReadFile or  ReadConsole, the cursor moves to the beginning of the next row when it reaches the end of the current row. This causes the rows displayed in the console window to scroll up automatically when the cursor advances beyond the last row in the window. It also causes the contents of the console screen buffer to scroll up (discarding the top row of the console screen buffer) when the cursor advances beyond the last row in the console screen buffer. If this mode is disabled, the last character in the row is overwritten with any subsequent characters.   ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING 0x0004   When writing with WriteFile or  WriteConsole, characters are parsed for VT100 and similar control character sequences that control cursor movement, color/font mode, and other operations that can also be performed via the existing Console APIs. For more information, see Console Virtual Terminal Sequences.   DISABLE_NEWLINE_AUTO_RETURN 0x0008   When writing with WriteFile or WriteConsole, this adds an additional state to end-of-line wrapping that can delay the cursor move and buffer scroll operations.    Normally when ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT is set and text reaches the end of the line, the cursor will immediately move to the next line and the contents of the buffer will scroll up by one line. In contrast with this flag set, the scroll operation and cursor move is delayed until the next character arrives. The written character will be printed in the final position on the line and the cursor will remain above this character as if ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT was off, but the next printable character will be printed as if ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT is on. No overwrite will occur. Specifically, the cursor quickly advances down to the following line, a scroll is performed if necessary, the character is printed, and the cursor advances one more position.  The typical usage of this flag is intended in conjunction with setting   ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING to better emulate a terminal emulator where writing the final character on the screen (in the bottom right corner) without triggering an immediate scroll is the desired behavior.      ENABLE_LVB_GRID_WORLDWIDE 0x0010   The APIs for writing character attributes including WriteConsoleOutput and WriteConsoleOutputAttribute allow the usage of flags from character attributes to adjust the color of the foreground and background of text. Additionally, a range of DBCS flags was specified with the COMMON_LVB prefix. Historically, these flags only functioned in DBCS code pages for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages. With exception of the leading byte and trailing byte flags, the remaining flags describing line drawing and reverse video (swap foreground and background colors) can be useful for other languages to emphasize portions of output. With exception of the leading byte and trailing byte flags, the remaining flags describing line drawing and reverse video (swap foreground and background colors) can be useful for other languages to emphasize portions of output. Setting this console mode flag will allow these attributes to be used in every code page on every language. It is off by default to maintain compatibility with known applications that have historically taken advantage of the console ignoring these flags on non-CJK machines to store bits in these fields for their own purposes or by accident.   Note that using the ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING mode can result in LVB grid and reverse video flags being set while this flag is still off if the attached application requests underlining or inverse video via Console Virtual Terminal Sequences."

A console process adds or removes additional handler functions by calling the  SetConsoleCtrlHandler function, which does not affect the list of handler functions for other processes.

In this case, the system terminates the process when  HandlerRoutine returns TRUE or when the time-out period elapses. When a console application is run as a service, it receives a modified default console control handler. This modified handler does not call  ExitProcess when processing the CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT and CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT signals. This allows the service to continue running after the user logs off. If the service installs its own console control handler, this handler is called before the default handler. If the installed handler calls  ExitProcess when processing the CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT signal, the service exits when the user logs off.

    "remarks": "This function provides a similar notification for console application and services that WM_QUERYENDSESSION provides for graphical applications with a message pump. You could also use this function from a graphical application, but there is no guarantee it would arrive before the notification from WM_QUERYENDSESSION. Each console process has its own list of application-defined  HandlerRoutine functions that handle CTRL+C and CTRL+BREAK signals. The handler functions also handle signals generated by the system when the user closes the console, logs off, or shuts down the system. Initially, the handler list for each process contains only a default handler function that calls the  ExitProcess function. A console process adds or removes additional handler functions by calling the  SetConsoleCtrlHandler function, which does not affect the list of handler functions for other processes. When a console process receives any of the control signals, its handler functions are called on a last-registered, first-called basis until one of the handlers returns TRUE. If none of the handlers returns TRUE, the default handler is called. For console processes, the CTRL+C and CTRL+BREAK key combinations are typically treated as signals (CTRL_C_EVENT and CTRL_BREAK_EVENT). When a console window with the keyboard focus receives CTRL+C or CTRL+BREAK, the signal is typically passed to all processes sharing that console. CTRL+BREAK is always treated as a signal, but typical CTRL+C behavior can be changed in three ways that prevent the handler functions from being called: A console process can use the  GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent function to send a CTRL+C or CTRL+BREAK signal to a console process group. The system generates CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT, CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT, and CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT signals when the user closes the console, logs off, or shuts down the system so that the process has an opportunity to clean up before termination. Console functions, or any C run-time functions that call console functions, may not work reliably during processing of any of the three signals mentioned previously. The reason is that some or all of the internal console cleanup routines may have been called before executing the process signal handler. Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10: If a console application loads the gdi32.dll or user32.dll library, the HandlerRoutine function that you specify  when you call SetConsoleCtrlHandler does not get called for the CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT and CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT events.  The operating system recognizes processes that load  gdi32.dll or user32.dll as Windows applications rather than console applications. This behavior also occurs for console applications that do not call functions in gdi32.dll or user32.dll  directly, but do call functions such as Shell functions that do in turn call functions in gdi32.dll or user32.dll. To receive events when a user signs out or the device shuts down in these circumstances, create a hidden window in your console application, and then handle the  WM_QUERYENDSESSION and WM_ENDSESSION window messages that the hidden window receives. You can create a hidden   window by calling the CreateWindowEx method with the dwExStyle parameter set to 0. For an example, see  Registering a Control Handler Function. ",

ReadConsole fails if used with a standard handle that has been redirected to be something other than a console handle. All of the input modes that affect the behavior of ReadFile have the same effect on  ReadConsole. To retrieve and set the input modes of a console input buffer, use the  GetConsoleMode and  SetConsoleMode functions. If the input buffer contains input events other than keyboard events (such as mouse events or window-resizing events), they are discarded. Those events can only be read by using the  ReadConsoleInput function. This function uses either Unicode characters or 8-bit characters from the console's current code page. The console's code page defaults initially to the system's OEM code page. To change the console's code page, use the  SetConsoleCP or  SetConsoleOutputCP functions, or use the chcp or mode con cp select= commands. The pInputControl parameter can be used to enable intermediate wakeups from the read in response to a file-completion control character specified in a CONSOLE_READCONSOLE_CONTROL structure. This feature requires command extensions to be enabled, the standard output handle to be a console output handle, and input to be Unicode. Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP/2000:  The intermediate read feature is not supported. ",

    "remarks": "ReadConsoleOutput treats the console screen buffer and the destination buffer as two-dimensional arrays (columns and rows of character cells). The rectangle pointed to by the lpReadRegion parameter specifies the size and location of the block to be read from the console screen buffer. A destination rectangle of the same size is located with its upper-left cell at the coordinates of the dwBufferCoord parameter in the lpBuffer array. Data read from the cells in the console screen buffer source rectangle is copied to the corresponding cells in the destination buffer. If the corresponding cell is outside the boundaries of the destination buffer rectangle (whose dimensions are specified by the dwBufferSize parameter), the data is not copied. Cells in the destination buffer corresponding to coordinates that are not within the boundaries of the console screen buffer are left unchanged. In other words, these are the cells for which no screen buffer data is available to be read. Before  ReadConsoleOutput returns, it sets the members of the structure pointed to by the lpReadRegion parameter to the actual screen buffer rectangle whose cells were copied into the destination buffer. This rectangle reflects the cells in the source rectangle for which there existed a corresponding cell in the destination buffer, because  ReadConsoleOutput clips the dimensions of the source rectangle to fit the boundaries of the console screen buffer. If the rectangle specified by lpReadRegion lies completely outside the boundaries of the console screen buffer, or if the corresponding rectangle is positioned completely outside the boundaries of the destination buffer, no data is copied. In this case, the function returns with the members of the structure pointed to by the lpReadRegion parameter set such that the Right member is less than the Left, or the Bottom member is less than the Top. To determine the size of the console screen buffer, use the  GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo function. The  ReadConsoleOutput function has no effect on the console screen buffer's cursor position.

The ENABLE_LINE_INPUT and ENABLE_ECHO_INPUT modes only affect processes that use  ReadFile or  ReadConsole to read from the console's input buffer. Similarly, the ENABLE_PROCESSED_INPUT mode primarily affects ReadFile and  ReadConsole users, except that it also determines whether Ctrl+C input is reported in the input buffer (to be read by the  ReadConsoleInput function) or is passed to a  HandlerRoutine function defined by the application. The ENABLE_WINDOW_INPUT and ENABLE_MOUSE_INPUT modes determine whether user interactions involving window resizing and mouse actions are reported in the input buffer or discarded. These events can be read by  ReadConsoleInput, but they are always filtered by ReadFile and  ReadConsole. The ENABLE_PROCESSED_OUTPUT and ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT modes only affect processes using ReadFile or  ReadConsole and WriteFile or  WriteConsole.

When a console is created, all input modes except ENABLE_WINDOW_INPUT are enabled by default.     ValueMeaning  ENABLE_ECHO_INPUT 0x0004   Characters read by the ReadFile or  ReadConsole function are written to the active screen buffer as they are read. This mode can be used only if the ENABLE_LINE_INPUT mode is also enabled.   ENABLE_EXTENDED_FLAGS 0x0080   Required to enable or disable extended flags. See ENABLE_INSERT_MODE and ENABLE_QUICK_EDIT_MODE.   ENABLE_INSERT_MODE 0x0020   When enabled, text entered in a console window will be inserted at the current cursor location and all text following that location will not be overwritten. When disabled, all following text will be overwritten.  To enable this mode, use ENABLE_INSERT_MODE | ENABLE_EXTENDED_FLAGS. To disable this mode, use ENABLE_EXTENDED_FLAGS without this flag.   ENABLE_LINE_INPUT 0x0002   The  ReadFile or  ReadConsole function returns only when a carriage return character is read. If this mode is disabled, the functions return when one or more characters are available.   ENABLE_MOUSE_INPUT 0x0010   If the mouse pointer is within the borders of the console window and the window has the keyboard focus, mouse events generated by mouse movement and button presses are placed in the input buffer. These events are discarded by  ReadFile or  ReadConsole, even when this mode is enabled.   ENABLE_PROCESSED_INPUT 0x0001   CTRL+C is processed by the system and is not placed in the input buffer. If the input buffer is being read by  ReadFile or  ReadConsole, other control keys are processed by the system and are not returned in the ReadFile or  ReadConsole buffer. If the ENABLE_LINE_INPUT mode is also enabled, backspace, carriage return, and line feed characters are handled by the system.   ENABLE_QUICK_EDIT_MODE 0x0040   This flag enables the user to use the mouse to select and edit text.  To enable this mode, use ENABLE_QUICK_EDIT_MODE | ENABLE_EXTENDED_FLAGS. To disable this mode, use ENABLE_EXTENDED_FLAGS without this flag.   ENABLE_WINDOW_INPUT 0x0008   User interactions that change the size of the console screen buffer are reported in the console's input buffer. Information about these events can be read from the input buffer by applications using the  ReadConsoleInput function, but not by those using ReadFile or  ReadConsole.   ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_INPUT 0x0200   Setting this flag directs the Virtual Terminal processing engine to convert user input received by the console window into Console Virtual Terminal Sequences that can be retrieved by a supporting application through ReadFile or ReadConsole functions. The typical usage of this flag is intended in conjunction with ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING on the output handle to connect to an application that communicates exclusively via virtual terminal sequences.     If the hConsoleHandle parameter is a screen buffer handle, the mode can be one or more of the following values. When a screen buffer is created, both output modes are enabled by default.  ValueMeaning  ENABLE_PROCESSED_OUTPUT 0x0001   Characters written by the  WriteFile or  WriteConsole function or echoed by the ReadFile or  ReadConsole function are examined for ASCII control sequences and the correct action is performed. Backspace, tab, bell, carriage return, and line feed characters are processed.   ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT 0x0002    When writing with WriteFile or  WriteConsole or echoing with  ReadFile or  ReadConsole, the cursor moves to the beginning of the next row when it reaches the end of the current row. This causes the rows displayed in the console window to scroll up automatically when the cursor advances beyond the last row in the window. It also causes the contents of the console screen buffer to scroll up (discarding the top row of the console screen buffer) when the cursor advances beyond the last row in the console screen buffer. If this mode is disabled, the last character in the row is overwritten with any subsequent characters.   ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING 0x0004   When writing with WriteFile or  WriteConsole, characters are parsed for VT100 and similar control character sequences that control cursor movement, color/font mode, and other operations that can also be performed via the existing Console APIs. For more information, see Console Virtual Terminal Sequences.   DISABLE_NEWLINE_AUTO_RETURN 0x0008   When writing with WriteFile or WriteConsole, this adds an additional state to end-of-line wrapping that can delay the cursor move and buffer scroll operations.    Normally when ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT is set and text reaches the end of the line, the cursor will immediately move to the next line and the contents of the buffer will scroll up by one line. In contrast with this flag set, the scroll operation and cursor move is delayed until the next character arrives. The written character will be printed in the final position on the line and the cursor will remain above this character as if ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT was off, but the next printable character will be printed as if ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT is on. No overwrite will occur. Specifically, the cursor quickly advances down to the following line, a scroll is performed if necessary, the character is printed, and the cursor advances one more position.  The typical usage of this flag is intended in conjunction with setting   ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING to better emulate a terminal emulator where writing the final character on the screen (in the bottom right corner) without triggering an immediate scroll is the desired behavior.      ENABLE_LVB_GRID_WORLDWIDE 0x0010   The APIs for writing character attributes including WriteConsoleOutput and WriteConsoleOutputAttribute allow the usage of flags from character attributes to adjust the color of the foreground and background of text. Additionally, a range of DBCS flags was specified with the COMMON_LVB prefix. Historically, these flags only functioned in DBCS code pages for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean languages. With exception of the leading byte and trailing byte flags, the remaining flags describing line drawing and reverse video (swap foreground and background colors) can be useful for other languages to emphasize portions of output. With exception of the leading byte and trailing byte flags, the remaining flags describing line drawing and reverse video (swap foreground and background colors) can be useful for other languages to emphasize portions of output. Setting this console mode flag will allow these attributes to be used in every code page on every language. It is off by default to maintain compatibility with known applications that have historically taken advantage of the console ignoring these flags on non-CJK machines to store bits in these fields for their own purposes or by accident.   Note that using the ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING mode can result in LVB grid and reverse video flags being set while this flag is still off if the attached application requests underlining or inverse video via Console Virtual Terminal Sequences."

The  SetConsoleCursorPosition function sets the current cursor position. Characters are written using the foreground and background color attributes associated with the console screen buffer. The  SetConsoleTextAttribute function changes these colors. To determine the current color attributes and the current cursor position, use  GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo. All of the input modes that affect the behavior of the WriteFile function have the same effect on  WriteConsole. To retrieve and set the output modes of a console screen buffer, use the  GetConsoleMode and  SetConsoleMode functions. The WriteConsole function uses either Unicode characters or ANSI characters from the console's current code page. The console's code page defaults initially to the system's OEM code page. To change the console's code page, use the  SetConsoleCP or  SetConsoleOutputCP functions, or use the chcp or mode con cp select= commands. WriteConsole fails if it is used with a standard handle that is redirected to a file. If an application processes multilingual output that can be redirected, determine whether the output handle is a console handle (one method is to call the GetConsoleMode function and check whether it succeeds). If the handle is a console handle, call WriteConsole. If the handle is not a console handle, the output is redirected and you should call WriteFile to perform the I/O. Be sure to prefix a Unicode plain text file with a byte order mark. For more information, see Using Byte Order Marks. Although an application can use  WriteConsole in ANSI mode to write ANSI characters, consoles do not support ANSI escape sequences. However, some functions provide equivalent functionality.

The rectangle pointed to by the lpWriteRegion parameter specifies the size and location of the block to be written to in the console screen buffer. A rectangle of the same size is located with its upper-left cell at the coordinates of the dwBufferCoord parameter in the lpBuffer array. Data from the cells that are in the intersection of this rectangle and the source buffer rectangle (whose dimensions are specified by the dwBufferSize parameter) is written to the destination rectangle. Cells in the destination rectangle whose corresponding source location are outside the boundaries of the source buffer rectangle are left unaffected by the write operation. In other words, these are the cells for which no data is available to be written. Before  WriteConsoleOutput returns, it sets the members of lpWriteRegion to the actual screen buffer rectangle affected by the write operation. This rectangle reflects the cells in the destination rectangle for which there existed a corresponding cell in the source buffer, because  WriteConsoleOutput clips the dimensions of the destination rectangle to the boundaries of the console screen buffer. If the rectangle specified by lpWriteRegion lies completely outside the boundaries of the console screen buffer, or if the corresponding rectangle is positioned completely outside the boundaries of the source buffer, no data is written. In this case, the function returns with the members of the structure pointed to by the lpWriteRegion parameter set such that the Right member is less than the Left, or the Bottom member is less than the Top. To determine the size of the console screen buffer, use the  GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo function. WriteConsoleOutput has no effect on the cursor position.
