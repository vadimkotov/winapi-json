    "remarks": "CreatePipe creates the pipe, assigning the specified pipe size to the storage buffer.  CreatePipe also creates handles that the process uses to read from and write to the buffer in subsequent calls to the ReadFile and WriteFile functions. To read from the pipe, a process uses the read handle in a call to the ReadFile function. ReadFile returns when one of the following is true: a write operation completes on the write end of the pipe, the number of bytes requested has been read, or an error occurs. When a process uses WriteFile to write to an anonymous pipe, the write operation is not completed until all bytes are written. If the pipe buffer is full before all bytes are written, WriteFile does not return until another process or thread uses ReadFile to make more buffer space available. Anonymous pipes are implemented using a named pipe with a unique name. Therefore, you can often pass a handle to an anonymous pipe to a function that requires a handle to a named pipe. If CreatePipe fails, the contents of the output parameters are indeterminate. No assumptions should be made about their contents in this event. To free resources used by a pipe, the application should always close handles when they are no longer needed, which is accomplished either by calling the CloseHandle function or when the process associated with the instance handles ends. Note that an instance of a pipe may have more than one handle associated with it. An instance of a pipe is always deleted when the last handle to the instance of the named pipe is closed.

    "remarks": "A named pipe server process can use  ConnectNamedPipe with a newly created pipe instance. It can also be used with an instance that was previously connected to another client process; in this case, the server process must first call the  DisconnectNamedPipe function to disconnect the handle from the previous client before the handle can be reconnected to a new client. Otherwise,  ConnectNamedPipe returns zero, and GetLastError returns ERROR_NO_DATA if the previous client has closed its handle or ERROR_PIPE_CONNECTED if it has not closed its handle. The behavior of  ConnectNamedPipe depends on two conditions: whether the pipe handle's wait mode is set to blocking or nonblocking and whether the function is set to execute synchronously or in overlapped mode. A server initially specifies a pipe handle's wait mode in the  CreateNamedPipe function, and it can be changed by using the  SetNamedPipeHandleState function. The server process can use any of the  wait functions or  SleepEx\u00e2\u0080\u0094 to determine when the state of the event object is signaled, and it can then use the HasOverlappedIoCompleted  macro to determine when the  ConnectNamedPipe operation completes. If the specified pipe handle is in nonblocking mode,  ConnectNamedPipe always returns immediately. In nonblocking mode,  ConnectNamedPipe returns a nonzero value the first time it is called for a pipe instance that is disconnected from a previous client. This indicates that the pipe is now available to be connected to a new client process. In all other situations when the pipe handle is in nonblocking mode,  ConnectNamedPipe returns zero. In these situations, GetLastError returns ERROR_PIPE_LISTENING if no client is connected, ERROR_PIPE_CONNECTED if a client is connected, and ERROR_NO_DATA if a previous client has closed its pipe handle but the server has not disconnected. Note that a good connection between client and server exists only after the ERROR_PIPE_CONNECTED error is received. For an example, see  Multithreaded Pipe Server. ",

    "remarks": "To create an instance of a named pipe by using  CreateNamedPipe, the user must have FILE_CREATE_PIPE_INSTANCE access to the named pipe object. If a new named pipe is being created, the access control list (ACL) from the security attributes parameter defines the discretionary access control for the named pipe. All instances of a named pipe must specify the same pipe type (byte-type or message-type), pipe access (duplex, inbound, or outbound), instance count, and time-out value. If different values are used, this function fails and GetLastError returns ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED. A client process connects to a named pipe by using the CreateFile or CallNamedPipe function. The client side of a named pipe starts out in byte mode, even if the server side is in message mode. To avoid problems receiving data, set the client side to message mode as well. To change the mode of the pipe, the pipe client must open a read-only pipe with GENERIC_READ and  FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES access. The pipe server should not perform a blocking read operation until the pipe client has started. Otherwise, a race condition can occur. This typically occurs when initialization code, such as the C run-time, needs to lock and examine inherited handles. Every time a named pipe is created, the system creates the inbound and/or outbound buffers using nonpaged pool, which is the physical memory used by the kernel. The number of pipe instances (as well as objects such as threads and processes) that you can create is limited by the available nonpaged pool. Each read or write request requires space in the buffer for the read or write data, plus additional space for the internal data structures. The input and output buffer sizes are advisory. The actual buffer size reserved for each end of the named pipe is either the system default, the system minimum or maximum, or the specified size rounded up to the next allocation boundary. The buffer size specified should be small enough that your process will not run out of nonpaged pool, but large enough to accommodate typical requests. Whenever a pipe write operation occurs, the system first tries to charge the memory against the pipe write quota. If the remaining pipe write quota is enough to fulfill the request, the write operation completes immediately. If the remaining pipe write quota is too small to fulfill the request, the system will try to expand the buffers to accommodate the data using nonpaged pool reserved for the process. The write operation will block until the data is read from the pipe so that the additional buffer quota can be released. Therefore, if your specified buffer size is too small, the system will grow the buffer as needed, but the downside is that the operation will block. If the operation is overlapped, a system thread is blocked; otherwise, the application thread is blocked. To free resources used by a named pipe, the application should always close handles when they are no longer needed, which is accomplished either by calling the CloseHandle function or when the process associated with the instance handles ends. Note that an instance of a named pipe may have more than one handle associated with it. An instance of a named pipe is always deleted when the last handle to the instance of the named pipe is closed.

This mode affects only write operations on byte-type pipes and, then, only when the client and server processes are on different computers. If this mode is enabled, functions writing to a named pipe do not return until the data written is transmitted across the network and is in the pipe's buffer on the remote computer. If this mode is not enabled, the system enhances the efficiency of network operations by buffering data until a minimum number of bytes accumulate or until a maximum time elapses.   FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED 0x40000000   Overlapped mode is enabled. If this mode is enabled, functions performing read, write, and connect operations that may take a significant time to be completed can return immediately. This mode enables the thread that started the operation to perform other operations while the time-consuming operation executes in the background. For example, in overlapped mode, a thread can handle simultaneous input and output (I/O) operations on multiple instances of a pipe or perform simultaneous read and write operations on the same pipe handle. If overlapped mode is not enabled, functions performing read, write, and connect operations on the pipe handle do not return until the operation is finished. The  ReadFileEx and  WriteFileEx functions can only be used with a pipe handle in overlapped mode. The  ReadFile,  WriteFile,  ConnectNamedPipe, and  TransactNamedPipe functions can execute either synchronously or as overlapped operations.

If hNamedPipe was opened with FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED, the lpOverlapped parameter must not be NULL. It must point to a valid OVERLAPPED structure. If hNamedPipe was created with FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED and lpOverlapped is NULL, the function can incorrectly report that the operation is complete. If hNamedPipe was opened with FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED and lpOverlapped is not NULL,  TransactNamedPipe is executed as an overlapped operation. The OVERLAPPED structure should contain a manual-reset event object (which can be created by using the  CreateEvent function). If the operation cannot be completed immediately,  TransactNamedPipe returns FALSE and GetLastError returns ERROR_IO_PENDING. In this situation, the event object is set to the nonsignaled state before  TransactNamedPipe returns, and it is set to the signaled state when the transaction has finished. Also, you can  be notified when an overlapped operation completes by using the GetQueuedCompletionStatus or GetQueuedCompletionStatusEx functions.  In this case, you do not need to assign the manual-reset event in the OVERLAPPED structure, and the completion happens against hNamedPipe in the same way as an asynchronous read or write operation. For more information about overlapped operations, see  Pipes. If hNamedPipe was not opened with FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED,  TransactNamedPipe does not return until the operation is complete."
