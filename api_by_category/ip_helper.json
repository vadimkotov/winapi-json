    "remarks": "The   GetAdaptersAddresses function can retrieve information for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Addresses are returned as a linked list of IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES structures in the buffer pointed to by the AdapterAddresses parameter. The application that calls the GetAdaptersAddresses function must allocate the amount of memory needed to return the IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES structures pointed to by the AdapterAddresses parameter. When these returned structures are no longer required, the application should free the memory allocated. This can be accomplished by calling the HeapAlloc function to allocate memory and later calling the HeapFree function to free the allocated memory, as shown in the example code. Other memory allocation and free functions can be used as long as the same family of functions are used for both the allocation and the free function. GetAdaptersAddresses is implemented only as a synchronous function call.  The GetAdaptersAddresses function requires a significant amount of network resources and time to complete since all of the low-level network interface tables must be traversed. One method that can be used to determine the memory needed to return the IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES structures pointed to by the AdapterAddresses parameter is to pass too small a buffer size as indicated in the SizePointer parameter in the first call to the GetAdaptersAddresses function,  so the function will fail with ERROR_BUFFER_OVERFLOW. When the return value is ERROR_BUFFER_OVERFLOW, the SizePointer parameter returned points to the required size of the buffer to hold the adapter information. Note that it is possible for the buffer size required for the IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES structures pointed to by the AdapterAddresses parameter to change between subsequent calls to the GetAdaptersAddresses function if an adapter address is added or removed.   However, this method of using the GetAdaptersAddresses function is strongly discouraged. This method requires calling the GetAdaptersAddresses function multiple times. The recommended method of calling the GetAdaptersAddresses function is to pre-allocate a 15KB working buffer pointed to by the AdapterAddresses parameter. On typical computers, this dramatically reduces the chances that the GetAdaptersAddresses function returns ERROR_BUFFER_OVERFLOW, which would require calling  GetAdaptersAddresses function multiple times. The example code illustrates this method of use. In versions prior to Windows 10, the order in which adapters appear in the list returned by this function can be controlled from the Network Connections folder: select the Advanced Settings menu item from the Advanced menu. Starting with Windows 10, the order in which adapters appear in the list is determined by the IPv4 or IPv6 route metric. If the GAA_FLAG_INCLUDE_ALL_INTERFACES is set, then all NDIS adapters will be retrieved even those addresses associated with adapters not bound to an address family specified in the Family parameter. When this flag is not set, then only the addresses that are bound to an adapter enabled for the address family specified in the Family parameter are returned. The size of the IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES structure was changed on Windows XP with Service Pack 1 (SP1) and later. Several additional members were added to this structure. The size of the IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES structure was also changed on Windows Vista and later. A number of additional members were added to this structure. The size of the       IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES structure also changed on       Windows Vista with Service Pack 1 (SP1)and later and onWindows Server 2008 and later. One additional member was added to this structure. The Length member of the IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES structure returned in the linked list of structures in the buffer pointed to by the AdapterAddresses parameter should be used to determine which version of the IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES structure is being used. The GetIpAddrTable function retrieves the interface\u00e2\u0080\u0093to\u00e2\u0080\u0093IPv4 address mapping table on a local computer and returns this information in an MIB_IPADDRTABLE structure. On the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) released for Windows Server 2003 and earlier, the return value for the GetAdaptersAddresses function was defined as a DWORD, rather than a ULONG. The SOCKET_ADDRESS structure is used in the IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES structure pointed to by the AdapterAddresses parameter. On the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) released for Windows Vista and later, the organization of header files has changed and the SOCKET_ADDRESS structure is defined in the Ws2def.h header file which is automatically included by the Winsock2.h header file. On the Platform SDK released for Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP, the SOCKET_ADDRESS structure is declared in the Winsock2.h header file. In order to use the IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES structure, the Winsock2.h header file must be included before the Iphlpapi.h header file. This example retrieves the IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES structure for the adapters associated with the system and prints some members  for each adapter interface. ",

    "header": "Iphlpapi.h",
    "return_value": "If the function succeeds, the return value is NO_ERROR. If the function fails, the return value is one of the following error codes.  ",
    "remarks": "The SendARP function is used to request the physical hardware address (sometimes referred to as the MAC address) that corresponds to a specified destination IPv4 address. If the information requested is not in the ARP table on the local computer, then the SendARP function will cause an ARP request to be sent to obtain the physical address. If the function is successful, the physical address that corresponds to the specified destination IPv4 address is returned in the array pointed to by the pMacAddr parameter. The physical address of an IPv4 address is only available if the destination IPv4 address is on the local subnet (the IPv4 address can be reached directly without going through any routers). The SendARP function will fail if the destination IPv4 address is not on the local subnet. If the SendARP function is successful on Windows Vista and later, the ARP table on the local computer is updated with the results.  If the SendARP function is successful on Windows Server 2003 and earlier, the ARP table on the local computer is not affected. The SendARP function on Windows Vista and later returns different error return values  than the  SendARP function on    Windows Server 2003 and earlier. On Windows Vista and later, a NULL pointer passed as the pMacAddr or PhyAddrLen parameter to the SendARP function causes an access violation and the application is terminated. If an error occurs on Windows Vista and later and ERROR_BAD_NET_NAME,  ERROR_BUFFER_OVERFLOW, or ERROR_NOT_FOUND is returned, the ULONG value pointed to by the PhyAddrLen parameter is set to zero. If the ULONG value pointed to by the PhyAddrLen parameter is less than 6 on  Windows Vista and later, SendARP function returns  ERROR_BUFFER_OVERFLOW indicating the buffer to receive the physical address is too small. If the SrcIp parameter specifies an IPv4 address that is not an interface on the local computer, the SendARP function on    Windows Vista and later  returns ERROR_NOT_FOUND. On Windows Server 2003 and earlier, a NULL pointer passed as the pMacAddr or PhyAddrLen parameter to the SendARP function returns ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER. If an error occurs on Windows Server 2003 and earlier and ERROR_GEN_FAILURE or   ERROR_INVALID_USER_BUFFER is returned, the ULONG value pointed to by the PhyAddrLen parameter is set to zero. If the ULONG value pointed to by the PhyAddrLen parameter is less than 6 on  Windows Server 2003 and earlier, the SendARP function does not return an error but only returns part of the hardware address in the array pointed to by the pMacAddr parameter. So if the value pointed to by the PhyAddrLen parameter is 4, then only the first 4 bytes of the hardware address are returned in the array pointed to by the pMacAddr parameter. If the SrcIp parameter specifies an IPv4 address that is not an interface on the local computer, the SendARP function on    Windows Server 2003 and  earlier ignores the SrcIp parameter and uses an IPv4 address on the local computer for the source IPv4 address. The GetIpNetTable function retrieves the ARP table on the local computer that maps IPv4 addresses to physical addresses.  The CreateIpNetEntry function creates an ARP entry in the ARP table on the local computer.  The DeleteIpNetEntry function deletes an ARP entry from the ARP table on the local computer.  The SetIpNetEntry function modifies an existing ARP entry in the ARP table on the local computer.  The FlushIpNetTable function deletes all ARP entries for the specified interface from the ARP table on the local computer. On Windows Vista and later, the ResolveIpNetEntry2 function can used to replace the SendARP function. An ARP request is sent if the Address member of the MIB_IPNET_ROW2 structure passed to the ResolveIpNetEntry2 function is an IPv4 address. On Windows Vista, a new group of functions can be used to access, modify, and delete the ARP table entries when the Address member of the MIB_IPNET_ROW2 structure passed to these functions is an IPv4 address.  The new functions include the following: GetIpNetTable2, CreateIpNetEntry2, DeleteIpNetEntry2,  FlushIpNetTable2, and SetIpNetEntry2. For information about the IPAddr data type, see  Windows Data Types. To convert an IP address between dotted decimal notation and IPAddr format, use the  inet_addr and  inet_ntoa functions. The following code demonstrates how to obtain the hardware or media access control (MAC) address associated with a specified IPv4 address. ",

GetIfTable2Ex is an enhanced version of the GetIfTable function that allows selecting the level of interface information to retrieve. A similar GetIfTable2 function can also be used to retrieve interfaces. but does not allow specifying the level of interfaces  to return. Calling the GetIfTable2Ex function with the Level parameter set to MibIfTableNormal retrieves the same results as calling the GetIfTable2 function. Interfaces are returned in a MIB_IF_TABLE2 structure in the buffer pointed to by the Table parameter. The MIB_IF_TABLE2 structure contains an interface count and an array of MIB_IF_ROW2 structures for each interface. Memory is allocated by the GetIfTable2 function for the MIB_IF_TABLE2 structure and the MIB_IF_ROW2 entries in this structure. When these returned structures are no longer required, free the memory by calling the FreeMibTable. All interfaces including NDIS intermediate driver interfaces and NDIS filter driver interfaces are returned for either of the possible values for the Level parameter. The setting for the Level parameter affects how statistics and state members of the MIB_IF_ROW2 structure in the MIB_IF_TABLE2 structure pointed to by the Table parameter for the interface are returned. For example, a network interface card (NIC)  will have a NDIS miniport driver.  An NDIS intermediate driver can be installed to  interface between upper-level protocol drivers and NDIS miniport drivers. An NDIS filter driver (LWF) can be attached on top of the NDIS intermediate driver. Assume that the NIC reports the MediaConnectState member of the  MIB_IF_ROW2 structure as MediaConnectStateConnected  but NDIS filter driver modifies the state and reports the state as MediaConnectStateDisconnected. When the interface information is queried with Level parameter set to MibIfTableNormal, the state at the top of the filter stack, that is MediaConnectStateDisconnected is reported. When the interface is queried with the Level parameter set to MibIfTableRaw, the state at the interface level directly, that is MediaConnectStateConnected is returned. Note that the returned MIB_IF_TABLE2 structure pointed to by the Table parameter may contain padding for alignment between the NumEntries member and the first MIB_IF_ROW2 array entry in the Table member of the MIB_IF_TABLE2 structure.

The required size is returned in the DWORD variable pointed to by the dwOutBufLen parameter. The  correct way to use the GetInterfaceInfo function is to call this function twice.

A buffer can then  be allocated of the required size using the value pointed by the dwOutBufLen.

    "remarks": "The CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry function is defined on Windows Vista and later. The CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry function is used to add a new unicast IP address entry on a local computer. The unicast IP address added by  the CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry function is not persistent. The IP address exists only as long as the adapter object exists. Restarting the computer destroys the IP address, as does manually resetting the network interface card (NIC). Also, certain PnP events may destroy the address. To create an IPv4 address that persists, the EnableStatic method of the Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration Class in the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) controls may be used. The netsh command can also be used to create a persistent IPv4 or IPv6 address.   For more information, please see the documentation on Netsh.exe in the Windows Sockets documentation. The InitializeUnicastIpAddressEntry function should be used to initialize the members of a     MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW structure entry with default values.  An application can then change the     members in the MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW entry it wishes to modify, and then call the CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry function. The Address member in the MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW structure pointed to by the Row parameter must be initialized to a valid unicast IPv4 or IPv6 address. The si_family member of the SOCKADDR_INET structure  in the  Address member must be initialized to either AF_INET or AF_INET6 and the related Ipv4 or Ipv6 member of the  SOCKADDR_INET structure must be set to a valid unicast IP address. In addition, at least one of the following members in the MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW structure pointed to the Row parameter must be initialized to the interface: the InterfaceLuid or InterfaceIndex.      The fields are used in the order listed above. So if the InterfaceLuid is specified, then this member is used to determine the interface on which to add the unicast IP address. If no value was set for the  InterfaceLuid member (the values of this member was set to zero), then the InterfaceIndex member is next used to determine the interface. If the OnLinkPrefixLength member of the MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW pointed to by the Row parameter is set to 255, then CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry will add the new unicast IP address with the  OnLinkPrefixLength member set equal to the length of the IP address. So for a unicast IPv4 address, the  OnLinkPrefixLength is set to 32 and the OnLinkPrefixLength is set to 128 for a unicast IPv6 address. If this would result in the incorrect subnet mask for an IPv4 address or the incorrect link prefix for an IPv6 address, then the application should set this member to the correct value before calling CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry. If a unicast IP address is created with the OnLinkPrefixLength member set incorrectly, then the IP address may be changed by calling SetUnicastIpAddressEntry with the  OnLinkPrefixLength member set to the correct value. The DadState, ScopeId, and CreationTimeStamp members of the MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW structure pointed to by the Row are ignored when the  CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry function is called. These members are set by the network stack. The  ScopeId member is automatically determined by the interface on which the address is added. Beginning in Windows 10, if DadState is set to IpDadStatePreferred in the MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW structure when calling CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry, the stack will set the initial DAD state of the address to \u00e2\u0080\u009cpreferred\u00e2\u0080\u009d instead of \u00e2\u0080\u009ctentative\u00e2\u0080\u009d and will do optimistic DAD for the address. The CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry function will fail if the unicast IP address passed in the Address member of the MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW pointed to by the Row parameter is a duplicate of an existing unicast IP address on the interface. Note that a loopback IP address can only be added to a loopback interface using the CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry function. The unicast IP address passed in the Address member of the MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW pointed to by the Row parameter is not usable immediately. The IP address is usable after the duplicate address detection process has completed successfully. It can take several seconds for the duplicate address detection process to complete since IP packets need to  be sent and potential responses must be awaited. For IPv6, the duplicate address detection process typically takes about a second. For IPv4, the duplicate address detection process typically takes about three seconds. If an application that needs to know when an IP address is usable after a call to  the CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry function, there are two methods that can be used. One method uses polling and the GetUnicastIpAddressEntry function. The second method calls one of the notification functions, NotifyAddrChange, NotifyIpInterfaceChange, or NotifyUnicastIpAddressChange to set up an asynchronous notification for when an address changes. The following method describes how to use the GetUnicastIpAddressEntry and polling. After the call to the CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry function returns successfully, pause for one to three seconds (depending on whether an IPv6 or IPv4 address is being created) to allow time for the successful completion of the duplication address detection process. Then call the GetUnicastIpAddressEntry function to retrieve the updated MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW structure and examine the value of the DadState member. If the value of the DadState member is set to IpDadStatePreferred, the IP address is now usable.  If the value of the DadState member is set to IpDadStateTentative, then duplicate address detection has not yet completed. In this case, call the GetUnicastIpAddressEntry function again every half a second while the DadState member is still set to IpDadStateTentative. If the value of the DadState member returns with some value other than IpDadStatePreferred or IpDadStateTentative, duplicate address detection has failed and the IP address is not usable. The following method describes how to use an appropriate notification function. After the call to the CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry function returns successfully, call the NotifyUnicastIpAddressChange function to register to be notified of changes to either IPv6 or IPv4 unicast IP addresses, depending on the type of IP address being created. When a notification is received for the IP address being created, call the GetUnicastIpAddressEntry function to retrieve the DadState member.  If the value of the DadState member is set to IpDadStatePreferred, the IP address is now usable.  If the value of the DadState member is set to IpDadStateTentative, then duplicate address detection has not yet completed and the application needs to wait for future notifications. If the value of the DadState member returns with some value other than IpDadStatePreferred or IpDadStateTentative, duplicate address detection has failed and the IP address is not usable. If during the duplicate address detection process the media is disconnected and then reconnected, the duplicate address detection process is restarted. So it is possible for the time to complete the process to increase beyond the typical 1 second value for IPv6 or 3 second value for IPv4. The CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry function can only be called by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group. If CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry is called by a user that is not a member of the Administrators group, the function call will fail and ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED is returned. This function can also fail because of user account control (UAC) on Windows Vista and later. If an application that contains this function is executed by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator, this call will fail unless the application has been marked in the manifest file with a requestedExecutionLevel set to requireAdministrator. If the application on lacks this manifest file, a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator must then be executing the application in an enhanced shell as the built-in Administrator (RunAs administrator) for this function to succeed. The following example demonstrates how to use the CreateUnicastIpAddressEntry function to add a new unicast IP address entry on the local computer. ",

    "remarks": "The NotifyStableUnicastIpAddressTable function is defined on Windows Vista and later. If the NotifyStableUnicastIpAddressTable function succeeds immediately, the return value is NO_ERROR and the stable unicast IP table is returned in the Table parameter.  The calling application should free the memory pointed to by the Table parameter using the FreeMibTable function when the MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_TABLE information is no longer needed. All unicast IP addresses except dial-on-demand addresses are considered stable only if they are in the preferred state.  For a normal unicast IP address entry, this would correspond to a DadState member of the MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW for the IP address set to IpDadStatePreferred.  Every dial-on-demand address defines its own stability metric.  Currently the only dial-on-demand address considered by this function is the unicast IP address used by the Teredo client on the local computer. The Family parameter must be set to either AF_INET, AF_INET6, or AF_UNSPEC. When NotifyStableUnicastIpAddressTable is successful and returns NO_ERROR, the Table parameter returns the stable unicast IP address table on the local computer. When NotifyStableUnicastIpAddressTable returns ERROR_IO_PENDING indicating that the I/O request is pending, then the  stable unicast IP address table is returned to the function in the CallerCallback  parameter. The NotifyStableUnicastIpAddressTable function is used primarily by applications that use the Teredo client. If the unicast IP address used by Teredo is available on the local computer but not in the stable (qualified) state, NotifyStableUnicastIpAddressTable returns ERROR_IO_PENDING and the stable unicast IP address table is eventually returned by  calling the function in the CallerCallback  parameter.  If the Teredo address is not available or is in the stable state and the other unicast IP addresses are in a stable state, then the function  in the CallerCallback  parameter will never be invoked. The callback function specified in the CallerCallback parameter should be defined as a function of type VOID. The parameters passed to the callback function include the following:   The callback function specified in the CallerCallback parameter must be implemented in the same process as the application calling the NotifyStableUnicastIpAddressTable function. If the callback function is in a separate DLL, then the DLL should be loaded before calling the NotifyStableUnicastIpAddressTable function to register for change notifications. The memory pointed to by the AddressTable parameter used in a callback indication is alocated by the operating system. An application that receives a notification should free the memory pointed to by the AddressTable parameter using the FreeMibTable function when the MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_TABLE information is no longer needed. Once the NotifyStableUnicastIpAddressTable function is called to register for change notifications, these notifications will continue to be sent until the application deregisters for change notifications or the application terminates. If the application terminates, the system will automatically deregister any registration for change notifications. It is still recommended that an application explicitly deregister any change notifications before it terminates. Any registration for change notifications does not persist if the system is shutdown or rebooted. To deregister for change notifications, call the  CancelMibChangeNotify2 function passing the NotificationHandle parameter returned by  NotifyStableUnicastIpAddressTable. An application cannot make a call to the CancelMibChangeNotify2 function from the context of the thread which is currently executing the notification callback function for the same NotificationHandle parameter. Otherwise, the thread executing that callback will result in deadlock. So the CancelMibChangeNotify2 function must not be called directly as part of the notification callback routine. In a more general situation, a thread that executes the CancelMibChangeNotify2 function cannot own a resource on which the thread that executes a notification callback operation would wait because it would result in a similar deadlock. The CancelMibChangeNotify2 function should be called from a different thread, on which the thread that receives the notification callback doesn't have dependencies on. ",

If the OnLinkPrefixLength member of the MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW pointed to by the Row parameter is set to 255, then SetUnicastIpAddressEntry will set the unicast IP address properties so that the OnLinkPrefixLength member is equal to the length of the IP address. So for a unicast IPv4 address, the  OnLinkPrefixLength is set to 32 and the OnLinkPrefixLength is set to 128 for a unicast IPv6 address. If this would result in the incorrect subnet mask for an IPv4 address or the incorrect link prefix for an IPv6 address, then the application should set this member to the correct value before calling SetUnicastIpAddressEntry. The DadState, ScopeId, and CreationTimeStamp members of the MIB_UNICASTIPADDRESS_ROW structure pointed to by the Row are ignored when the  SetUnicastIpAddressEntry  function is called. These members are set by the network stack and cannot be changed using the SetUnicastIpAddressEntry  function. The  ScopeId member is automatically determined by the interface on which the address was added. The SetUnicastIpAddressEntry function can only be called by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group. If SetUnicastIpAddressEntry is called by a user that is not a member of the Administrators group, the function call will fail and ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED is returned. The SetUnicastIpAddressEntry function can also fail because of user account control (UAC) on Windows Vista and later. If an application that contains this function is executed by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator, this call will fail unless the application has been marked in the manifest file with a requestedExecutionLevel set to requireAdministrator. If the application lacks this manifest file, a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator must then be executing the application in an enhanced shell as the built-in Administrator (RunAs administrator) for this function to succeed.

There can only be one double-colon in the string representation of the IPv6 address. The last 32 bits may be represented in IPv4-style dotted-octet notation     if the address is an IPv4-compatible address, an IPv4-mapped IPv6 address, or an ISATAP address. For more information, see section 5 of RFC 5942 published by the IETF. On success, the Terminator parameter points to the character that terminated the string that was converted. This allows an application to pass a string that contains and IP address plus additional information to the RtlIpv6StringToAddress function and then parse the remaining information. When either UNICODE or _UNICODE is defined, RtlIpv6StringToAddress is defined to RtlIpv6StringToAddressW, the Unicode version of this function. The S and Terminator parameters are defined to the PCWSTR data type. When both UNICODE and _UNICODE are not defined, RtlIpv6StringToAddress is defined to RtlIpv6StringToAddressA, the ANSI version of this function.

When dwForwardAge is set to INFINITE, the route will not be removed based on a timeout   value. Any other value for dwForwardAge specifies the number of seconds until the TCP/IP stack will remove the route from the network routing table.  A route modified by SetIpForwardEntry will automatically have a default value for dwForwardAge of INFINITE. A number of members of the MIB_IPFORWARDROW structure  pointed to by the route parameter are not currently used by SetIpForwardEntry. These members include dwForwardPolicy, dwForwardType, dwForwardAge, dwForwardNextHopAS, dwForwardMetric1, dwForwardMetric2, dwForwardMetric3, dwForwardMetric4, and dwForwardMetric5. To create a new route in the IP routing table, use the  CreateIpForwardEntry function. To retrieve the IP routing table, call the GetIpForwardTable function. On Windows Vista and later, the SetIpForwardEntry function can only be called by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group. If SetIpForwardEntry is called by a user that is not a member of the Administrators group, the function call will fail and ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED is returned. This function can also fail because of user account control (UAC) on Windows Vista and later. If an application that contains this function is executed by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator, this call will fail unless the application has been marked in the manifest file with a requestedExecutionLevel set to requireAdministrator. If the application lacks this manifest file, a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator must then be executing the application in an enhanced shell as the built-in Administrator (RunAs administrator) for this function to succeed. The following example demonstrates how to change the default gateway to NewGateway. Simply calling GetIpForwardTable, changing the gateway and then calling SetIpForwardEntry will not change the route, but rather will just add a new one. If for some reason there are multiple default gateways present, this code will delete them. Note that the new gateway must be viable; otherwise, TCP/IP will ignore the change.   Windows Vista and later:  When the DeleteIpForwardEntry function and then SetIpForwardEntry function are called for the same route table entry on Windows Vista and later, ERROR_NOT_FOUND is returned. The proper way to replicate this example on Windows Vista and later is to use the CreateIpForwardEntry function to create the new route table entry and then delete the old route table entry by calling the DeleteIpForwardEntry function.

In a more general situation, a thread that executes the CancelMibChangeNotify2 function cannot own a resource on which the thread that executes a notification callback operation would wait because it would result in a similar deadlock. The CancelMibChangeNotify2 function should be called from a different thread, on which the thread that receives the notification callback doesn't have dependencies on. ",

    "remarks": "The CreatePersistentTcpPortReservation function is defined on Windows Vista and later. The CreatePersistentTcpPortReservation function is used to add a persistent reservation for a block of TCP ports. Applications and services which need to reserve ports fall into two categories. The first category includes components which need a particular port as part of their operation. Such components will generally prefer to specify their required port at installation time (in an application manifest, for example). The second category includes components which need any available port or block of ports at runtime.   These two categories correspond to specific and wildcard port reservation requests. Specific reservation requests may be persistent or runtime, while wildcard port reservation requests are only supported at runtime. The CreatePersistentTcpPortReservation function provides the ability for an application or service to reserve a persistent block of TCP ports.  Persistent TCP port reservations are recorded in a persistent store for the TCP module in Windows. A caller obtains a persistent port reservation by specifying how many ports are required and whether a specific range is needed. If the request can be satisfied, the CreatePersistentTcpPortReservation function returns a unique opaque ULONG64 token, which subsequently identifies the reservation. A persistent TCP port reservation may be released by calling the DeletePersistentTcpPortReservation function. Note that the token for a given persistent TCP port reservation may change each time the system is restarted. Windows does not implement inter-component security for persistent reservations obtained using these functions. This means that if a component is granted the ability to obtain any persistent port reservations, that component automatically gains the ability to consume any persistent port reservations granted to any other component on the system. Process-level security is enforced for runtime reservations, but such control cannot be extended to persistent port reservations created using the CreatePersistentTcpPortReservation or  CreatePersistentUdpPortReservation function. Once a persistent TCP port reservation has been obtained, an application can request port assignments from the TCP port reservation by opening a TCP socket, then calling the WSAIoctl function specifying the SIO_ASSOCIATE_PORT_RESERVATION IOCTL and passing the reservation token before issuing a call to the bind function on the socket. The SIO_ACQUIRE_PORT_RESERVATION IOCTL can be used to request a runtime reservation for a block of TCP or UDP ports. For runtime port reservations, the port pool requires that reservations be consumed from the process on whose socket the reservation was granted. Runtime port reservations last only as long as the lifetime of the socket on which the SIO_ACQUIRE_PORT_RESERVATION IOCTL was called.  In contrast, persistent port reservations created using the CreatePersistentTcpPortReservation function may be consumed by any process with the ability to obtain persistent reservations. The CreatePersistentTcpPortReservation function can only be called by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group. If CreatePersistentTcpPortReservation is called by a user that is not a member of the Administrators group, the function call will fail and ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED is returned. This function can also fail because of user account control (UAC) on Windows Vista and later. If an application that contains this function is executed by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator, this call will fail unless the application has been marked in the manifest file with a requestedExecutionLevel set to requireAdministrator. If the application lacks this manifest file, a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator must then be executing the application in an enhanced shell as the built-in Administrator (RunAs administrator) for this function to succeed. The following example creates a persistent TCP port reservation, then creates a socket and allocates a port from the port reservation, and then closes the socket and deletes the TCP port reservation. This example must be run by a user that is a member of the Administrators group. The simplest way to run this example is in an enhanced shell as the built-in Administrator (RunAs administrator). ",

The   NotifySecurityHealthChange function is used to register for a change notification for network security health on  a local computer. A change to security health will occur when  a TCP SYN attack against the local computer takes place. A TCP SYN attack is one form of a denial of service attempt. The   NotifySecurityHealthChange function may be called in two ways: If the pHandle and  pOverLapped parameters are NULL, then the NotifySecurityHealthChange function call is synchronous and will block until the security health has changed (the value pointed to by the SecurityHealthFlags parameter). If the NotifySecurityHealthChange function is called synchronously, a notification will be sent on the next security health change until the application terminates. If the pHandle and  pOverLapped parameters are not NULL, then the NotifySecurityHealthChange function call is asynchronous and results are returned when the state of security health changes (the value pointed to by the SecurityHealthFlags parameter). In this case, the function registers for a notification. The parameter passed in the pOverLapped parameter must point to a valid OVERLAPPED structure. The caller can use the returned handle pointed to by the pHandle parameter with the OVERLAPPED structure to receive asynchronous notification of a security health changes using the GetOverlappedResult function. See the following topics for information about using the handle and  OVERLAPPED structure to receive notifications: Each call to the NotifySecurityHealthChange function will result in a single notification. So once the NotifySecurityHealthChange function returns, if further notification is required then the function must be called again. When the NotifySecurityHealthChange function call is asynchronous, an application can deregister for security change notification (cancel the pending notification request) by calling the CancelSecurityHealthChangeNotify function with the notifyOverlapped parameter set to the value returned in pOverLapped parameter returned from the NotifySecurityHealthChange function. If the NotifySecurityHealthChange function is called asynchronously, a notification will be sent on the next security health change until either the application cancels the notification by calling the CancelSecurityHealthChangeNotify function or the application terminates. If the application terminates, the system will automatically cancel the registration for the notification. It is still recommended that an application explicitly cancel any notification before it terminates. Any registration for a security health notification does not persist across a system shut down or reboot. ",

The parameters passed to the callback function include the following:   The callback function specified in the Callback parameter must be implemented in the same process as the application calling the NotifyTeredoPortChange function. If the callback function is in a separate DLL, then the DLL should be loaded before calling the NotifyTeredoPortChange function to register for change notifications.

An application cannot make a call to the CancelMibChangeNotify2 function from the context of the thread which is currently executing the notification callback function for the same NotificationHandle parameter.

The GetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats function is designed to use TCP to diagnose performance    problems in both the network and the application.  If a network based    application is performing poorly, TCP can determine if the bottleneck    is in the sender, the receiver or the network itself.  If the    bottleneck is in the network, TCP can provide specific information    about its nature. The GetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats function retrieves extended statistics for the IPv6 TCP connection passed in the Row parameter. The type of extended statistics that is retrieved is specified in the EstatsType parameter. Extended statistics on this TCP connection must have previously been enabled by calls to the SetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats function for all TCP_ESTATS_TYPE values except when TcpConnectionEstatsSynOpts is passed in the EstatsType parameter. The GetTcp6Table function is used to retrieve the IPv6 TCP connection table on the local computer. This function returns a MIB_TCP6TABLE structure that contain an array of MIB_TCP6ROW entries. The Row parameter passed to the GetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats function must be an entry for an existing IPv6 TCP connection. The only version of TCP connection statistics currently supported is version zero. So the RwVersion, RosVersion, and RodVersion parameters passed to GetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats should be set to 0. For information on extended TCP statistics on an IPv4 connection, see the GetPerTcpConnectionEStats and SetPerTcpConnectionEStats functions. The SetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats function can only be called by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group. If SetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats is called by a user that is not a member of the Administrators group, the function call will fail and ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED is returned. This function can also fail because of user account control (UAC) on Windows Vista and later. If an application that contains this function is executed by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator, this call will fail unless the application has been marked in the manifest file with a requestedExecutionLevel set to requireAdministrator. If the application lacks this manifest file, a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator must then be executing the application in an enhanced shell as the built-in Administrator (RunAs administrator) for this function to succeed. An application that uses the GetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats function to retrieve extended statistics for an IPv6 TCP connection must check that the previous call to the SetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats function to enabled extended statistics returned with success. If the SetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats function to enable extended statistics failed, subsequent calls to the GetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats will still return numbers in the returned structures. However the returned numbers are meaningless random data and don't represent extended TCP statistics. This behavior can be observed by running the example below as both an administrator and a normal user. The following example retrieves the TCP extended statistics for an IPv4 and IPv6 TCP connection and prints values from the returned data. ",

If SetPerTcpConnectionEStats is called by a user that is not a member of the Administrators group, the function call will fail and ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED is returned. This function can also fail because of user account control (UAC) on Windows Vista and later. If an application that contains this function is executed by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator, this call will fail unless the application has been marked in the manifest file with a requestedExecutionLevel set to requireAdministrator. If the application lacks this manifest file, a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator must then be executing the application in an enhanced shell as the built-in Administrator (RunAs administrator) for this function to succeed. An application that uses the GetPerTcpConnectionEStats function to retrieve extended statistics for an IPv4 TCP connection must check that the previous call to the SetPerTcpConnectionEStats function to enabled extended statistics returned with success. If the SetPerTcpConnectionEStats function to enable extended statistics failed, subsequent calls to the GetPerTcpConnectionEStats will still return numbers in the returned structures. However the returned numbers are meaningless random data and don't represent extended TCP statistics. This behavior can be observed by running the example below as both an administrator and a normal user. The following example retrieves the TCP extended statistics for an IPv4 and IPv6 TCP connection and prints values from the returned data. ",

    "remarks": "The SetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats function is defined on Windows Vista and later. The SetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats function is used to enable or disable extended statistics for the IPv6 TCP connection passed in the Row parameter. Extended statistics on a TCP connection are disabled by default. The SetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats function is used to set the value of a member in the read/write information for extended statistics for an IPv6 TCP connection. The type and format of the structure to be set is specified by the EstatsType parameter. The Rw parameter contains a pointer to the structure being passed. The member to set in this structure is specified by the Offset parameter. All members in the structure pointed to by Rw parameter must be specified. The only version of TCP connection statistics currently supported is version zero. So the RwVersion parameter passed to SetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats should be set to 0. The structure pointed to by the Rw parameter passed this function depends on the enumeration value passed in the EstatsType parameter. The following table below indicates the structure type that should be passed in the Rw parameter for each possible EstatsType parameter type.   The Offset parameter is currently unused. The possible structures pointed to by the Rw parameter all have a single member except for the TCP_ESTATS_BANDWIDTH_RW_v0 structure.  When the EstatsType parameter is set to TcpConnectionEstatsBandwidth, the TCP_ESTATS_BANDWIDTH_RW_v0 structure pointed to by the Rw parameter must have both structure members set to the preferred values in a single call to the  SetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats function. If the RwSize parameter is set to 0, the SetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats function  returns NO_ERROR and makes no changes tothe extended statistics status. The GetTcp6Table function is used to retrieve the IPv6 TCP connection table on the local computer. This function returns a MIB_TCP6TABLE structure that contain an array of MIB_TCP6ROW entries. The Row parameter passed to the SetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats function must be an entry for an existing IPv6 TCP connection. Once extended statistics are enabled on a TCP connection for IPv6, an application calls the GetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats function to retrieve extended statistics on the TCP connection. The GetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats function is designed to use TCP to diagnose performance    problems in both the network and the application.  If a network based    application is performing poorly, TCP can determine if the bottleneck    is in the sender, the receiver or the network itself.  If the    bottleneck is in the network, TCP can provide specific information    about its nature. For information on extended TCP statistics on an IPv4 connection, see the GetPerTcpConnectionEStats and SetPerTcpConnectionEStats functions. The SetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats function can only be called by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group. If SetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats is called by a user that is not a member of the Administrators group, the function call will fail and ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED is returned. This function can also fail because of user account control (UAC) on Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. If an application that contains this function is executed by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator, this call will fail unless the application has been marked in the manifest file with a requestedExecutionLevel set to requireAdministrator. If the application on Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 lacks this manifest file, a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator must then be executing the application in an enhanced shell as the built-in Administrator (RunAs administrator) for this function to succeed.

    "remarks": "The SetPerTcpConnectionEStats function is defined on Windows Vista and later. The SetPerTcpConnectionEStats function is used to enable or disable extended statistics on an IPv4 TCP connection passed in the Row parameter. Extended statistics on a TCP connection are disabled by default. The SetPerTcpConnectionEStats function is used to set the value of a member in the read/write information for extended statistics for an IPv4 TCP connection. The type and format of the structure to be set is specified by the EstatsType parameter. The Rw parameter contains a pointer to the structure being passed.  All members in the structure pointed to by Rw parameter must be specified. The only version of TCP connection statistics currently supported is version zero. So the RwVersion parameter passed to SetPerTcpConnectionEStats should be set to 0. The structure pointed to by the Rw parameter passed this function depends on the enumeration value passed in the EstatsType parameter. The following table below indicates the structure type that should be passed in the Rw parameter for each possible EstatsType parameter type.   The Offset parameter is currently unused and must be set to 0. The possible structures pointed to by the Rw parameter all have a single member except for the TCP_ESTATS_BANDWIDTH_RW_v0 structure.  When the EstatsType parameter is set to TcpConnectionEstatsBandwidth, the TCP_ESTATS_BANDWIDTH_RW_v0 structure pointed to by the Rw parameter must have both structure members set  to the preferred values in a single call to the  SetPerTcpConnectionEStats function. If the RwSize parameter is set to 0, the SetPerTcpConnectionEStats function  returns NO_ERROR and makes no changes tothe extended statistics status. The GetTcpTable function is used to retrieve the IPv4 TCP connection table on the local computer. This function returns a MIB_TCPTABLE structure that contain an array of MIB_TCPROW entries. The Row parameter passed to the SetPerTcpConnectionEStats function must be an entry for an existing IPv4 TCP connection. Once extended statistics are enabled on a TCP connection for IPv4, applications call the GetPerTcpConnectionEStats function to retrieve extended statistics on the TCP connection. The GetPerTcpConnectionEStats function is designed to use TCP to diagnose performance    problems in both the network and the application.  If a network based    application is performing poorly, TCP can determine if the bottleneck    is in the sender, the receiver or the network itself.  If the    bottleneck is in the network, TCP can provide specific information    about its nature. For information on extended TCP statistics on an IPv6 connection, see the GetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats and SetPerTcp6ConnectionEStats functions. The SetPerTcpConnectionEStats function can only be called by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group. If SetPerTcpConnectionEStats is called by a user that is not a member of the Administrators group, the function call will fail and ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED is returned. This function can also fail because of user account control (UAC) on Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. If an application that contains this function is executed by a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator, this call will fail unless the application has been marked in the manifest file with a requestedExecutionLevel set to requireAdministrator. If the application on Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 lacks this manifest file, a user logged on as a member of the Administrators group other than the built-in Administrator must then be executing the application in an enhanced shell as the built-in Administrator (RunAs administrator) for this function to succeed.
