    "remarks": "Identifying the current operating system is usually not the best way to determine whether a particular operating system feature is present. This is because the operating system may have had new features added in a redistributable DLL. Rather than using  GetVersionEx to determine the operating system platform or version number, test for the presence of the feature itself. For more information, see  Operating System Version. The GetSystemMetrics function provides additional information about the current operating system.  To check for specific operating systems or operating system features, use the IsOS function. The GetProductInfo function retrieves the product type. To retrieve information for the operating system on a remote computer, use the NetWkstaGetInfo function, the Win32_OperatingSystem WMI class, or the OperatingSystem property of the IADsComputer interface. To compare the current system version to a required version, use the  VerifyVersionInfo function instead of using  GetVersionEx to perform the comparison yourself. If compatibility mode is in effect, the GetVersionEx function reports the operating system as it identifies itself, which may not be the operating system that is installed. For example, if compatibility mode is in effect, GetVersionEx reports the operating system that is selected for application compatibility. When using the  GetVersionEx function to determine whether your application is running on a particular version of the operating system, check for version numbers that are greater than or equal to the desired version numbers. This ensures that the test succeeds for later versions of the operating system. For example, if your application requires Windows XP or later, use the following test. For an example that identifies the current operating system, see  Getting the System Version. ",

    "remarks": "The  VerifyVersionInfo function retrieves version information about the currently running operating system and compares it to the valid members of the lpVersionInfo structure. This enables you to easily determine the presence of a required set of operating system version conditions. It is preferable to use  VerifyVersionInfo rather than calling the  GetVersionEx function to perform your own comparisons. Typically,  VerifyVersionInfo returns a nonzero value only if all specified tests succeed. However, major, minor, and service pack versions are tested in a hierarchical manner because the operating system version is a combination of these values. If a condition exists for the major version, it supersedes the conditions specified for minor version and service pack version. (You cannot test for major version greater than 5 and minor version less than or equal to 1. If you specify such a test, the function will change the request to test for a minor version greater than 1 because it is performing a greater than operation on the major version.) The function tests these values in this order: major version, minor version, and service pack version. The function continues testing values while they are equal, and stops when one of the values does not meet the specified condition. For example, if you test for a system greater than or equal to version 5.1 service pack 1, the test succeeds if the current version is 6.0. (The major version is greater than the specified version, so the testing stops.) In the same way, if you test for a system greater than or equal to version 5.1 service pack 1, the test succeeds if the current version is 5.2. (The minor version is greater than the specified versions, so the testing stops.) However, if you test for a system greater than or equal to version 5.1 service pack 1, the test fails if the current version is 5.0 service pack 2. (The minor version is not greater than the specified version, so the testing stops.) To verify a range of system versions, you must call  VerifyVersionInfo twice. For example, to verify that the system version is greater than 5.0 but less than or equal to 5.1, first call  VerifyVersionInfo to test that the major version is 5 and the minor version is greater than 0, then call  VerifyVersionInfo again to test that the major version is 5 and the minor version is less than or equal to 1. Identifying the current operating system is usually not the best way to determine whether a particular operating system feature is present. This is because the operating system may have had new features added in a redistributable DLL. Rather than using  GetVersionEx to determine the operating system platform or version number, test for the presence of the feature itself. For more information, see  Operating System Version. To verify whether the current operating system is either the Media Center or Tablet PC version of Windows, call GetSystemMetrics. Windows 10:  VerifyVersionInfo returns false when called by applications that do not have a compatibility manifest for Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 if the lpVersionInfo parameter is set so that it specifies Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, even when the current operating system version is Windows 8.1 or Windows 10. Specifically, VerifyVersionInfo has the following behavior: The Version Helper functions use the VerifyVersionInfo function, so the behavior IsWindows8Point1OrGreater and IsWindows10OrGreater are similarly affected by the presence and content of the manifest. To manifest your applications for Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, see Targeting your application for Windows. For an example, see  Verifying the System Version. ",

SYSTEM_EXCEPTION_INFORMATION   When the SystemInformationClass  parameter is SystemExceptionInformation, the buffer pointed to by the SystemInformation parameter should be large enough to hold an opaque SYSTEM_EXCEPTION_INFORMATION structure for use in generating an unpredictable seed for a random number generator. For this purpose, the structure has the following layout:        Copy     typedef struct _SYSTEM_EXCEPTION_INFORMATION {     BYTE Reserved1[16]; } SYSTEM_EXCEPTION_INFORMATION;     Individual members of the structure are reserved for internal use by the operating system. Use the CryptGenRandom  function instead to generate cryptographically random data.  SYSTEM_INTERRUPT_INFORMATION   When the SystemInformationClass  parameter is SystemInterruptInformation, the buffer pointed to by the SystemInformation parameter should be large enough to hold an array that contains as many opaque  SYSTEM_INTERRUPT_INFORMATION structures as there are  processors (CPUs) installed on the system. Each structure, or the array as a whole, can be used to generate an unpredictable seed for a random number generator. For this purpose, the structure has the following layout:        Copy     typedef struct _SYSTEM_INTERRUPT_INFORMATION {     BYTE Reserved1[24]; } SYSTEM_INTERRUPT_INFORMATION;     Individual members of the structure are reserved for internal use by the operating system.

For the last item in the array, NextEntryOffset is 0. The HandleCount member contains the total number of handles being used by the process in question; use GetProcessHandleCount  to retrieve this information instead. The PeakPagefileUsage member contains the  maximum number of bytes of page-file storage used by the process, and the PrivatePageCount member contains the number of memory pages allocated for the use of this process. You can also retrieve this information using either the GetProcessMemoryInfo function or the Win32_Process class. The  other members of the structure are reserved for internal use by the operating system.  SYSTEM_PROCESSOR_PERFORMANCE_INFORMATION   When the SystemInformationClass  parameter is SystemProcessorPerformanceInformation,  the buffer pointed to by the SystemInformation parameter should be large enough to hold an array that contains as many SYSTEM_PROCESSOR_PERFORMANCE_INFORMATION structures as there are processors (CPUs) installed in the system.
