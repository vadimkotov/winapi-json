An application can change an activated window's position in the Z order without restrictions, or it can activate a window and then move it to the top of the topmost or non-topmost windows.

The window seen on the screen corresponds to the physical coordinates. The application continues to work in logical space. Therefore, the application's view of the window is different from that which appears on the screen. For scaled windows, logical and physical coordinates are different. LogicalToPhysicalPoint is a transformation API that can be called by a process that declares itself as dpi aware. The function uses the window identified by the hWnd parameter and the logical coordinates given in the POINT structure to compute the physical coordinates. The LogicalToPhysicalPoint function replaces the logical coordinates in the POINT structure with the physical coordinates. The physical coordinates are relative to the upper-left corner of the screen. The coordinates have to be inside the client area of hWnd. On all platforms, LogicalToPhysicalPoint will fail on a window that has either 0 width or height; an application must first establish a non-0 width and height by calling, for example, MoveWindow.  On some versions of Windows (including Windows 7), LogicalToPhysicalPoint will still fail if MoveWindow has been called after a call to ShowWindow with SH_HIDE has hidden the window. In Windows 8, system\u00e2\u0080\u0093DPI aware applications translate between physical and logical space using PhysicalToLogicalPoint and LogicalToPhysicalPoint. In Windows 8.1, the additional virtualization of the system and inter-process communications means that for the majority of applications, you do not need these APIs. As a result, in Windows 8.1, PhysicalToLogicalPoint and LogicalToPhysicalPoint no longer transform points. The system returns all points to an application in its own coordinate space.  This behavior preserves functionality for the majority of applications, but there are some exceptions in which you must make changes to ensure that the application works as expected. In those cases, use PhysicalToLogicalPointForPerMonitorDPI and LogicalToPhysicalPointForPerMonitorDPI. ",

    "remarks": "Windows Vista introduces the concept of physical coordinates. Desktop Window Manager (DWM) scales non-dots per inch (dpi) aware windows when the display is high dpi. The window seen on the screen corresponds to the physical coordinates. The application continues to work in logical space. Therefore, the application's view of the window is different from that which appears on the screen. For scaled windows, logical and physical coordinates are different. The function uses the window identified by the hWnd parameter and the physical coordinates given in the POINT structure to compute the logical coordinates. The logical coordinates are the unscaled coordinates that appear to the application in a programmatic way. In other words, the logical coordinates are the coordinates the application recognizes, which can be different from the physical coordinates. The API then replaces the physical coordinates with the logical coordinates. The new coordinates are in the world coordinates whose origin is (0, 0) on the desktop. The coordinates passed to the API have to be on the hWnd. The source coordinates are in device units. On all platforms, PhysicalToLogicalPoint will fail on a window that has either 0 width or height; an application must first establish a non-0 width and height by calling, for example, MoveWindow.  On some versions of Windows (including Windows 7), PhysicalToLogicalPoint will still fail if MoveWindow has been called after a call to ShowWindow with SH_HIDE has hidden the window. In Windows 8, system\u00e2\u0080\u0093DPI aware applications translate between physical and logical space using PhysicalToLogicalPoint and LogicalToPhysicalPoint. In Windows 8.1, the additional virtualization of the system and inter-process communications means that for the majority of applications, you do not need these APIs. As a result, in Windows 8.1, PhysicalToLogicalPoint and LogicalToPhysicalPoint no longer transform points. The system returns all points to an application in its own coordinate space.  This behavior preserves functionality for the majority of applications, but there are some exceptions in which you must make changes to ensure that the application works as expected. In those cases, use PhysicalToLogicalPointForPerMonitorDPI and LogicalToPhysicalPointForPerMonitorDPI. ",

    "remarks": "As part of the Vista re-architecture, all services were moved off the interactive desktop into Session 0. hwnd and window manager operations are only effective inside a session and cross-session attempts to manipulate the hwnd will fail. For more information, see The Windows Vista Developer Story: Application Compatibility Cookbook. If you have changed certain window data using SetWindowLong, you must call SetWindowPos for the changes to take effect. Use the following combination for uFlags: SWP_NOMOVE | SWP_NOSIZE | SWP_NOZORDER | SWP_FRAMECHANGED. A window can be made a topmost window either by setting the hWndInsertAfter parameter to HWND_TOPMOST and ensuring that the SWP_NOZORDER flag is not set, or by setting a window's position in the Z order so that it is above any existing topmost windows. When a non-topmost window is made topmost, its owned windows are also made topmost. Its owners, however, are not changed. If neither the SWP_NOACTIVATE nor SWP_NOZORDER flag is specified (that is, when the application requests that a window be simultaneously activated and its position in the Z order changed), the value specified in hWndInsertAfter is used only in the following circumstances. An application cannot activate an inactive window without also bringing it to the top of the Z order. Applications can change an activated window's position in the Z order without restrictions, or it can activate a window and then move it to the top of the topmost or non-topmost windows. If a topmost window is repositioned to the bottom (HWND_BOTTOM) of the Z order or after any non-topmost window, it is no longer topmost. When a topmost window is made non-topmost, its owners and its owned windows are also made non-topmost windows. A non-topmost window can own a topmost window, but the reverse cannot occur. Any window (for example, a dialog box) owned by a topmost window is itself made a topmost window, to ensure that all owned windows stay above their owner. If an application is not in the foreground, and should be in the foreground, it must call the SetForegroundWindow function. To use SetWindowPos to bring a window to the top, the process that owns the window must have SetForegroundWindow permission. For an example, see Initializing a Dialog Box. ",

This permits seamless animation of the layered window. UpdateLayeredWindowIndirect always updates the entire window.

For best drawing performance by the layered window and any underlying windows, the layered window should be as small as possible.
