This flag is useful for loading a bitmap without mapping it to the colors of the display device.   LR_DEFAULTCOLOR 0x00000000   The default flag; it does nothing.

All pixels in the image that use that entry become the default window color. This value applies only to images that have corresponding color tables. Do not use this option if you are loading a bitmap with a color depth greater than 8bpp. If fuLoad includes both the LR_LOADTRANSPARENT and LR_LOADMAP3DCOLORS values, LR_LOADTRANSPARENT takes precedence. However, the color table entry is replaced with COLOR_3DFACE rather than COLOR_WINDOW.   LR_MONOCHROME 0x00000001   Loads the image in black and white.   LR_SHARED 0x00008000   Shares the image handle if the image is loaded multiple times. If LR_SHARED is not set, a second call to LoadImage for the same resource will load the image again and return a different handle.  When you use this flag, the system will destroy the resource when it is no longer needed. Do not use LR_SHARED for images that have non-standard sizes, that may change after loading, or that are loaded from a file. When loading a system icon or cursor, you must use LR_SHARED or the function will fail to load the resource. This function finds the first image in the cache with the requested resource name, regardless of the size requested.   LR_VGACOLOR 0x00000080   Uses true VGA colors."
