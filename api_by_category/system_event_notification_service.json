For standalone computers that are directly connected to a network through a network card or remote access server (RAS), this function generates minimal network traffic with RPC calls to the nearest router. For computers that are part of a network where a destination can be reached by using RAS or a network gateway, this function pings a destination to generate accurate QOC information. This function is only available for TCP/IP connections. A caller supplies the buffer for the  QOCINFO structure, and must release the memory when it is not needed. Starting with applications designed for Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, developers should consider using the Network List Manager instead of this function. ",

A directory service type of application, e-mail client, or Internet browser can adapt to various types of network connectivity. For example, a printing operation can be deferred until a network connection is available. It may not always be practical for an application to call  IsNetworkAlive to determine whether or not a  local system is disconnected from a LAN, because IsNetworkAlive can be slow, and it may take too much time for the function to detect that a local system is disconnected.
