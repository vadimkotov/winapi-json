    "remarks": "The accumulation buffer is an extended-range color buffer. Images are not rendered into it. Rather, images rendered into one of the color buffers are added to the contents of the accumulation buffer after rendering. You can create effects such as antialiasing (of points, lines, and polygons), motion blur, and depth of field by accumulating images generated with different transformation matrices. Each pixel in the accumulation buffer consists of red, green, blue, and alpha values. The number of bits per component in the accumulation buffer depends on the implementation. You can examine this number by calling glGetIntegerv four times, with the arguments GL_ACCUM_RED_BITS, GL_ACCUM_GREEN_BITS, GL_ACCUM_BLUE_BITS, and GL_ACCUM_ALPHA_BITS, respectively. Regardless of the number of bits per component, however, the range of values stored by each component is [ 1,?1]. The accumulation buffer pixels are mapped one-to-one with framebuffer pixels. The glAccum function operates on the accumulation buffer. The first argument, op, is a symbolic constant that selects an accumulation buffer operation. The second argument, value, is a floating-point value to be used in that operation. Five operations are specified: GL_ACCUM, GL_LOAD, GL_ADD, GL_MULT, and GL_RETURN. All accumulation buffer operations are limited to the area of the current scissor box and are applied identically to the red, green, blue, and alpha components of each pixel. The contents of an accumulation buffer pixel component are undefined if the glAccum operation results in a value outside the range [ 1,1]. To clear the accumulation buffer, use the glClearAccum function to specify R, G, B, and A values to set it to, and issue a glClear function with the accumulation buffer enabled. Only those pixels within the current scissor box are updated by any glAccum operation. The following functions retrieve information related to the glAccum function: glGet with argument GL_ACCUM_RED_BITS glGet with argument GL_ACCUM_GREEN_BITS glGet with argument GL_ACCUM_BLUE_BITS glGet with argument GL_ACCUM_ALPHA_BITS ",

With glAddSwapHintRectWIN, you specify a set of rectangular areas that you want copied when you call SwapBuffers. When you do not specify any rectangles with glAddSwapHintRectWIN before calling SwapBuffers, the entire framebuffer is swapped. Using glAddSwapHintRectWIN to copy only changed parts of the buffer can significantly increase the performance of SwapBuffers, especially when SwapBuffers is implemented in software. The glAddSwapHintRectWIN function adds a rectangle to the hint region. When the PFD_SWAP_COPY flag of the PIXELFORMATDESCRIPTOR pixel format structure is set, SwapBuffers uses this region to clip the copying of the back buffer to the front buffer. You don't specify PFD_SWAP_COPY; it is set by capable hardware. The hint region is cleared after each call to SwapBuffers. With some hardware configurations, SwapBuffers can ignore the hint region and exchange the entire buffer. SwapBuffers is implemented by the system, not by the application. OpenGL maintains a separate hint region for each window. When you call glAddSwapHintRectWIN on any rendering contexts associated with a window, the hint rectangles are combined into a single region. Call glAddSwapHintRectWIN with a bounding rectangle for each object drawn for a frame and for each rectangle cleared to erase previous frame objects. ",

Calling glBindTexture with target set to GL_TEXTURE_1D or GL_TEXTURE_2D, and texture set       to the name of the new texture you have created binds the texture name to the appropriate texture target. When a texture is bound to a target, the previous binding for that target is no longer in effect. Texture names are unsigned integers with the value zero reserved to represent the default texture for each texture target. Texture names and the corresponding texture contents are local to the       shared display-list space of the current OpenGL rendering context; two rendering contexts share texture names only if they also share display lists. You can generate a set of new texture names       using glGenTextures. When a texture is first bound, it assumes the dimensionality of its texture target; a texture bound to GL_TEXTURE_1D becomes one-dimensional and a texture bound to GL_TEXTURE_2D becomes        two-dimensional. Operations you perform on a texture target also affect a texture bound to the target. When you query a texture target, the return value is the state of the texture bound to it.        Texture targets become aliases for textures currently bound to them. When you bind a texture with glBindTexture, the binding remains active until a different texture is bound to the same target or       you delete the bound texture with the glDeleteTextures function. Once you create a named texture you can bind it to a texture target        that has the same dimensionality as often as needed. It is usually much faster to use glBindTexture to bind an existing named texture to one of the texture targets than it is to        reload the texture image using glTexImage1D or glTexImage2D.

    "return_value": "This function does not return a value.  The following error codes can be retrieved by the glGetError function.  The following error codes can be retrieved by the glGetError function. ",
    "remarks": "In RGB mode, pixels can be drawn using a function that blends the incoming (source) RGBA values with the RGBA values that are already in the framebuffer (the destination values). By default, blending is disabled. Use glEnable and glDisable with the GL_BLEND argument to enable and disable blending. When enabled, glBlendFunc defines the operation of blending. The sfactor parameter specifies which of nine methods is used to scale the source color components. The dfactor parameter specifies which of eight methods is used to scale the destination color components. The eleven possible methods are described in the following table. Each method defines four scale factors\u00e2\u0080\u0094one each for red, green, blue, and alpha. In the table and in subsequent equations, source and destination color components are referred to as (R\u00e2\u0082\u009b , G\u00e2\u0082\u009b , B\u00e2\u0082\u009b , A\u00e2\u0082\u009b ) and (Rd , Gd , Bd , Ad ). They are understood to have integer values between zero and (kR , kG , kR , kA ), where kR = 2mR - 1 kG = 2mG - 1 kB = 2mB - 1 kA = 2mA - 1 and (mR ,  mG , mB , mA ) is the number of red, green, blue, and alpha bitplanes. Source and destination scale factors are referred to as (sR , sG , sB , sA ) and (dR , dG , dB , dA ). The scale factors described in the table, denoted (fR , fG , fB , fA ), represent either source or destination factors. All scale factors have range [0,1].  In the table, i = min (A\u00e2\u0082\u009b , kA  - Ad ) / kA To determine the blended RGBA values of a pixel when drawing in RGBA mode, the system uses the following equations: R (d) = min( kR , R\u00e2\u0082\u009b sR + Rd dR ) G (d) = min( kG , G\u00e2\u0082\u009b sG + Gd dG  ) B (d) = min( kB , B\u00e2\u0082\u009b sB + Bd dB  ) A (d) = min( kA , A\u00e2\u0082\u009b sA + Ad dA  ) Despite the apparent precision of the above equations, blending arithmetic is not exactly specified, because blending operates with imprecise integer color values. However, a blend factor that should be equal to one is guaranteed not to modify its multiplicand, and a blend factor equal to zero reduces its multiplicand to zero. Thus, for example, when sfactor is GL_SRC_ALPHA, dfactor is GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, and A\u00e2\u0082\u009b is equal to kA, the equations reduce to simple replacement: Rd = R\u00e2\u0082\u009b Gd = G\u00e2\u0082\u009b Bd = B\u00e2\u0082\u009b Ad = A\u00e2\u0082\u009b Transparency is best implemented using glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA) with primitives sorted from farthest to nearest. Note that this transparency calculation does not require the presence of alpha bitplanes in the framebuffer. You can also use glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA) for rendering antialiased points and lines in arbitrary order. To optimize polygon antialiasing, use glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA_SATURATE, GL_ONE) with polygons sorted from nearest to farthest. (See the GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH argument in glEnable for information on polygon antialiasing.) Destination alpha bitplanes, which must be present for this blend function to operate correctly, store the accumulated coverage. Incoming (source) alpha is a material opacity, ranging from 1.0 (KA ), representing complete opacity, to 0.0 (0), representing complete transparency. When you enable more than one color buffer for drawing, each enabled buffer is blended separately, and the contents of the buffer is used for destination color. (See glDrawBuffer.) Blending affects only RGBA rendering. It is ignored by color-index renderers.

    "remarks": "Paletted textures are defined with a palette of colors and a set of image data that is composed of indexes to color entries of a palette (a color table). The glColorTableEXT function specifies the texture palette of a targeted texture. It takes the data from memory and converts the data as if each palette entry is a single pixel of a 1-D texture. The glColorTableEXT function unpacks and converts the data and translates it into an internal format that matches the given format as closely as possible. If a palette's width is greater than the range of the color indexes in the texture data, some of the palette entries are unused. If a palette's width is less than the range of the color indexes in the texture data, the most significant bits of the texture data are ignored and only the appropriate number of bits in the index are used when accessing the palette. When you specify a proxy target using PROXY_TEXTURE_1D or PROXY_TEXTURE_2D, the palette of the proxy texture is resized and its parameters are set but no data is transferred or accessed. When the target parameter is GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_1D or GL_PROXY_TEXTURE_2D, and the implementation does not support the values specified for either format or width, glColorTableEXT can fail to create the requested color table. In this case, the color table is empty and all parameters retrieved will be zero. You can determine whether OpenGL supports a particular color table format and size by calling glColorTableEXT with a proxy target, and then calling glGetColorTableParameterivEXT or glGetColorTableParameterfvEXT to determine whether the width parameter matches that set by glColorTableEXT. If the retrieved width is zero, the color table request by glColorTable failed. If the retrieved width is not zero, you can call glColorTable with the real target with TEXTURE_1D or TEXTURE_2D to set the color table. To retrieve the actual color table data specified by the glColorTableEXT function, call glGetColorTableEXT.

Its operation is well defined only if the entire pixel source region is within the exposed portion of the window. Results of copies from outside the window, or from regions of the window that are not exposed, are hardware dependent and undefined. The x and y parameters specify the window coordinates of the lower-left corner of the rectangular region to be copied. The width and height parameters specify the dimensions of the rectangular region to be copied. Both width and height must be nonnegative. Several parameters control the processing of the pixel data while it is being copied. These parameters are set with three functions: glPixelTransfer, glPixelMap, and glPixelZoom. This topic describes the effects on glCopyPixels of most, but not all, of the parameters specified by these three functions. The glCopyPixels function copies values from each pixel with the lower-left corner at (x + i, y + j) for 0 \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 i < width and 0 \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 j < height. This pixel is said to be the i pixel in the j row. Pixels are copied in row order from the lowest to the highest row, left to right in each row. The type parameter specifies whether color, depth, or stencil data is to be copied. The rasterization described thus far assumes pixel zoom factors of 1.0. If you use glPixelZoom to change the x and y pixel zoom factors, pixels are converted to fragments as follows. If (xr , yr ) is the current raster position, and a given pixel is in the i location in the j row of the source pixel rectangle, then fragments are generated for pixels whose centers are in the rectangle with corners at (xr + zoom\u00e2\u0082\u0093 i, yr + zoomy j) and (xr + zoom\u00e2\u0082\u0093 (i + 1), yr + zoomy (j + 1)) where zoom\u00e2\u0082\u0093 is the value of GL_ZOOM_X and zoomy is the value of GL_ZOOM_Y.

In either case, zero bits fill otherwise unspecified bit locations in the result.  If GL_MAP_COLOR is true, the index is replaced with the value that it references in lookup table GL_PIXEL_MAP_I_TO_I.

If OpenGL is in RGBA mode:  The red, green, blue, and alpha components of each pixel that is read are converted to an internal floating-point format with unspecified precision.

The resulting floating-point color values are then multiplied by GL_c_SCALE and added to GL_c_BIAS, where c is RED, GREEN, BLUE, and ALPHA for the respective color components. The results are clamped to the range [0,1]. If GL_MAP_COLOR is true, each color component is scaled by the size of lookup table GL_PIXEL_MAP_c_TO_c, and then replaced by the value that it references in that table; c is R, G, B, or A, respectively. \t\t\t\t  The resulting indexes or RGBA colors are then converted to fragments by attaching the current raster position z-coordinate and texture coordinates to each pixel, and then assigning window coordinates (xr + i, yr + j), where (xr , yr ) is the current raster position, and the pixel was the pixel in the i position in the j row.

Thus, the values accepted by glDepthRange are both clamped to this range before they are accepted. The default mapping of (0,1) maps the near plane to 0 and the far plane to 1. With this mapping, the depth buffer range is fully utilized. It is not necessary that zNear be less than zFar. Reverse mappings such as (1,0) are acceptable. The following function retrieves information related to glDepthRange: glGet with argument GL_DEPTH_RANGE ",

    "remarks": "The glDrawPixels function reads pixel data from memory and writes it into the framebuffer relative to the current raster position. Use glRasterPos to set the current raster position, and use glGet with argument GL_CURRENT_RASTER_POSITION to query the raster position. Several parameters define the encoding of pixel data in memory and control the processing of the pixel data before it is placed in the framebuffer. These parameters are set with four functions: glPixelStore, glPixelTransfer, glPixelMap, and glPixelZoom. This topic describes the effects on glDrawPixels of many, but not all, of the parameters specified by these four functions. Data is read from pixels as a sequence of signed or unsigned bytes, signed or unsigned shorts, signed or unsigned integers, or single-precision floating-point values, depending on type. Each of these bytes, shorts, integers, or floating-point values is interpreted as one color or depth component, or one index, depending on format. Indexes are always treated individually. Color components are treated as groups of one, two, three, or four values, again based on format. Both individual indexes and groups of components are referred to as pixels. If type is GL_BITMAP, the data must be unsigned bytes, and format must be either GL_COLOR_INDEX or GL_STENCIL_INDEX. Each unsigned byte is treated as eight 1-bit pixels, with bit ordering determined by GL_UNPACK_LSB_FIRST (see glPixelStore). The width by height pixels are read from memory, starting at location pixels. By default, these pixels are taken from adjacent memory locations, except that after all width pixels are read, the read pointer is advanced to the next 4-byte boundary. The glPixelStore function specifies the 4-byte row alignment with argument GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, and you can set it to 1, 2, 4, or 8 bytes. Other pixel store parameters specify different read pointer advancements, both before the first pixel is read, and after all width pixels are read. The glPixelStore function operates on each of the width-by-height pixels that it reads from memory in the same way, based on the values of several parameters specified by glPixelTransfer and glPixelMap. The details of these operations, as well as the target buffer into which the pixels are drawn, are specific to the format of the pixels, as specified by format. The rasterization described thus far assumes pixel zoom factors of 1.0. If you use glPixelZoom to change the x and y pixel zoom factors, pixels are converted to fragments as follows. If (xr,yr) is the current raster position, and a given pixel is in the nth column and mth row of the pixel rectangle, then fragments are generated for pixels whose centers are in the rectangle with corners at (xr + zoom\u00e2\u0082\u0093 n, yr + zoomy m) (xr + zoom\u00e2\u0082\u0093 (n + 1), yr + zoomy (m + 1)) where zoom\u00e2\u0082\u0093 is the value of GL_ZOOM_X and zoomy is the value of GL_ZOOM_Y.

Take OpenGL out of feedback mode by calling glRenderMode with a parameter value other than GL_FEEDBACK. When you do this while OpenGL is in feedback mode, glRenderMode returns the number of entries placed in the feedback array. The returned value never exceeds size. If the feedback data required more room than was available in buffer, glRenderMode returns a negative value. While in feedback mode, each primitive that would be rasterized generates a block of values that gets copied into the feedback array. If doing so would cause the number of entries to exceed the maximum, glFeedbackBuffer partially writes the block so as to fill the array (if there is any room left at all), and sets an overflow flag. Each block begins with a code indicating the primitive type, followed by values that describe the primitive's vertices and associated data. The glFeedbackBuffer function also writes entries for bitmaps and pixel rectangles. Feedback occurs after polygon culling and glPolygonMode interpretation of polygons has taken place, so polygons that are culled are not returned in the feedback buffer. It can also occur after polygons with more than three edges are broken up into triangles, if the OpenGL implementation renders polygons by performing this decomposition. You can insert a marker into the feedback buffer with glPassThrough. The following is the grammar for the blocks of values written into the feedback buffer. Each primitive is indicated with a unique identifying value followed by some number of vertices. Polygon entries include an integer value indicating how many vertices follow. A vertex is fed back as some number of floating-point values, as determined by type. Colors are fed back as four values in RGBA mode and one value in color-index mode. feedbackList <\u00e2\u0080\u0094 feedbackItem feedbackList | feedbackItem feedbackItem <\u00e2\u0080\u0094 point | lineSegment | polygon | bitmap | pixelRectangle | passThru point <\u00e2\u0080\u0094 GL_POINT_TOKEN vertex lineSegment <\u00e2\u0080\u0094 GL_LINE_TOKEN vertex vertex | GL_LINE_RESET_TOKEN vertex vertex polygon <\u00e2\u0080\u0094 GL_POLYGON_TOKEN n polySpec polySpec <\u00e2\u0080\u0094 polySpec vertex | vertex vertex vertex bitmap <\u00e2\u0080\u0094 GL_BITMAP_TOKEN vertex pixelRectangle <\u00e2\u0080\u0094 GL_DRAW_PIXEL_TOKEN vertex | GL_COPY_PIXEL_TOKEN vertex passThru <\u00e2\u0080\u0094 GL_PASS_THROUGH_TOKEN value vertex <\u00e2\u0080\u0094 2d | 3d | 3dColor | 3dColorTexture | 4dColorTexture 2d <\u00e2\u0080\u0094 value value 3d <\u00e2\u0080\u0094 value value value 3dColor <\u00e2\u0080\u0094 value value value color 3dColorTexture <\u00e2\u0080\u0094 value value value color tex 4dColorTexture <\u00e2\u0080\u0094 value value value value color tex color <\u00e2\u0080\u0094 rgba | index rgba <\u00e2\u0080\u0094 value value value value index <\u00e2\u0080\u0094 value tex <\u00e2\u0080\u0094 value value value value The value parameter is a floating-point number, and n is a floating-point integer giving the number of vertices in the polygon. The following are symbolic floating-point constants: GL_POINT_TOKEN, GL_LINE_TOKEN, GL_LINE_RESET_TOKEN, GL_POLYGON_TOKEN, GL_BITMAP_TOKEN, GL_DRAW_PIXEL_TOKEN, GL_COPY_PIXEL_TOKEN, and GL_PASS_THROUGH_TOKEN. GL_LINE_RESET_TOKEN is returned whenever the line stipple pattern is reset. The data returned as a vertex depends on the feedback type. The following table gives the correspondence between type and the number of values per vertex; k is 1 in color-index mode and 4 in RGBA mode.  Feedback vertex coordinates are in window coordinates, except w, which is in clip coordinates. Feedback colors are lighted, if lighting is enabled. Feedback texture coordinates are generated, if texture coordinate generation is enabled. They are always transformed by the texture matrix. The glFeedbackBuffer function, when used in a display list, is not compiled into the display list but rather is executed immediately.

The (left, bottom, zNear) and (right, top, zNear) parameters specify the points on the near clipping plane that are mapped to the lower-left and upper-right corners of the window, respectively, assuming that the eye is located at (0,0,0). The zFar parameter specifies the location of the far clipping plane. Both zNear and zFar must be positive. The corresponding matrix is shown in the following image. The glFrustum function multiplies the current matrix by this matrix, with the result replacing the current matrix. That is, if M is the current matrix and F is the frustum perspective matrix, then glFrustum replaces M with M \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 F. Use glPushMatrix and glPopMatrix to save and restore the current matrix stack. Depth-buffer precision is affected by the values specified for zNear and zFar.

The target parameter specifies whether the desired texture image is one specified by glTexImage1D(GL_TEXTURE_1D) or by glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D). The level parameter specifies the level-of-detail number of the desired image. The format and type parameters specify the format and type of the desired image array. For a description of the acceptable values for the format and type parameters, respectively, see glTexImage1D and glDrawPixels. Operation of glGetTexImage is best understood by considering the selected internal four-component texture image to be an RGBA color buffer the size of the image. The semantics of glGetTexImage are then identical to those of glReadPixels called with the same format and type, with x and y set to zero, width set to the width of the texture image (including border if one was specified), and height set to one for 1-D images, or to the height of the texture image (including border, if one was specified) for 2-D images. Because the internal texture image is an RGBA image, pixel formats GL_COLOR_INDEX, GL_STENCIL_INDEX, and GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT are not accepted, and pixel type GL_BITMAP is not accepted. If the selected texture image does not contain four components, the following mappings are applied. Single-component textures are treated as RGBA buffers with red set to the single-component value, and green, blue, and alpha set to zero. Two-component textures are treated as RGBA buffers, with red set to the value of component zero, alpha set to the value of component one, and green and blue set to zero. Finally, three-component textures are treated as RGBA buffers with red set to component zero, green set to component one, blue set to component two, and alpha set to zero. To determine the required size of pixels, use glGetTexLevelParameter to ascertain the dimensions of the internal texture image, and then scale the required number of pixels by the storage required for each pixel, based on format and type. Be sure to take the pixel-storage parameters into account, especially GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT. If an error is generated, no change is made to the contents of pixels. The following functions retrieve information related to glGetTexImage: glGet with argument GL_PACK_ALIGNMENT and others glGetTexLevelParameter with argument GL_TEXTURE_WIDTH glGetTexLevelParameter with argument GL_TEXTURE_HEIGHT glGetTexLevelParameter with argument GL_TEXTURE_BORDER glGetTexLevelParameter with argument GL_TEXTURE_COMPONENTS ",

The masking is achieved by using three parameters: the 16-bit line stipple pattern pattern, the repeat count factor, and an integer stipple counter s. Counter s is reset to zero whenever glBegin is called, and before each line segment of a glBegin(GL_LINES)/glEnd sequence is generated. It is incremented after each fragment of a unit width aliased line segment is generated, or after each i fragments of an i width line segment are generated. The i fragments associated with count s are masked out if pattern bit (s / factor) mod 16 is zero. Otherwise these fragments are sent to the framebuffer. Bit zero of pattern is the least significant bit. Antialiased lines are treated as a sequence of 1xwidth rectangles for purposes of stippling. Rectangle s is rasterized or not based on the fragment rule described for aliased lines; it counts rectangles rather than groups of fragments.

    "remarks": "The glLineWidth function specifies the rasterized width of both aliased and antialiased lines. Using a line width other than 1.0 has different effects, depending on whether line antialiasing is enabled. Line antialiasing is controlled by calling glEnable and glDisable with argument GL_LINE_SMOOTH. If line antialiasing is disabled, the actual width is determined by rounding the supplied width to the nearest integer. (If the rounding results in the value 0.0, it is as if the line width were 1.0) If | \u00ce\u0094 x | \u00e2\u0089\u00a5 | \u00ce\u0094 y |, i pixels are filled in each column that is rasterized, where i is the rounded value of width. Otherwise, i pixels are filled in each row that is rasterized. If antialiasing is enabled, line rasterization produces a fragment for each pixel square that intersects the region lying within the rectangle having width equal to the current line width, length equal to the actual length of the line, and centered on the mathematical line segment. The coverage value for each fragment is the window coordinate area of the intersection of the rectangular region with the corresponding pixel square. This value is saved and used in the final rasterization step. Not all widths can be supported when line antialiasing is enabled. If an unsupported width is requested, the nearest supported width is used. Only width 1.0 is guaranteed to be supported; others depend on the implementation. The range of supported widths and the size difference between supported widths within the range can be queried by calling glGet with arguments GL_LINE_WIDTH_RANGE and GL_LINE_WIDTH_GRANULARITY. The line width specified by glLineWidth is always returned when GL_LINE_WIDTH is queried. Clamping and rounding for aliased and antialiased lines have no effect on the specified value. Non-antialiased line width may be clamped to an implementation-dependent maximum. Although this maximum cannot be queried, it must be no less than the maximum value for antialiased lines, rounded to the nearest integer value.

    "remarks": "The glPointSize function specifies the rasterized diameter of both aliased and antialiased points. Using a point size other than 1.0 has different effects, depending on whether point antialiasing is enabled. Point antialiasing is controlled by calling glEnable and glDisable with argument GL_POINT_SMOOTH. If point antialiasing is disabled, the actual size is determined by rounding the supplied size to the nearest integer. (If the rounding results in the value 0, it is as if the point size were 1.) If the rounded size is odd, then the center point (x,y) of the pixel fragment that represents the point is computed as (xw + .5, yw + .5) where w subscripts indicate window coordinates. All pixels that lie within the square grid of the rounded size centered at (x,y) make up the fragment. If the size is even, the center point is (xw + .5, yw + .5) and the rasterized fragment's centers are the half-integer window coordinates within the square of the rounded size centered at (x,y). All pixel fragments produced in rasterizing a nonantialiased point are assigned the same associated data; that of the vertex corresponding to the point. If antialiasing is enabled, then point rasterization produces a fragment for each pixel square that intersects the region lying within the circle having diameter equal to the current point size and centered at the points (xw ,yw ). The coverage value for each fragment is the window coordinate area of the intersection of the circular region with the corresponding pixel square. This value is saved and used in the final rasterization step. The data associated with each fragment is the data associated with the point being rasterized. Not all sizes are supported when point antialiasing is enabled. If an unsupported size is requested, the nearest supported size is used. Only size 1.0 is guaranteed to be supported; others depend on the implementation. The range of supported sizes and the size difference between supported sizes within the range can be queried by calling glGet with arguments GL_POINT_SIZE_RANGE and GL_POINT_SIZE_GRANULARITY. The point size specified by glPointSize is always returned when GL_POINT_SIZE is queried. Clamping and rounding for aliased and antialiased points have no effect on the specified value. Non-antialiased point size may be clamped to an implementation-dependent maximum. Although this maximum cannot be queried, it must be no less than the maximum value for antialiased points, rounded to the nearest integer value.

Polygon stippling, like line stippling (see glLineStipple), masks out certain fragments produced by rasterization, creating a pattern. Stippling is independent of polygon antialiasing.

That is, the stipple pattern is represented as a 32x32 array of 1-bit color indexes packed in unsigned bytes. The glPixelStore function parameters, such as GL_UNPACK_SWAP_BYTES and GL_UNPACK_LSB_FIRST, affect the assembling of the bits into a stipple pattern. Pixel transfer operations (shift, offset, and pixel map) are not applied to the stipple image, however.

On computers with a limited amount of texture memory, OpenGL establishes a \"working set\" of textures that are resident in texture memory. These textures can be bound to a texture target much more efficiently than textures that are not resident. By specifying a priority for each texture, the glPrioritizeTextures function enables you to determine which textures should be resident. The texture priorities elements in priorities are clamped to the range [0.0, 1.0] before being assigned. Zero indicates the lowest priority; thus textures with priority zero are least likely to be resident. The value 1.0 indicates the highest priority; thus textures with priority 1.0 are most likely to be resident. However, textures are not guaranteed to be resident until they are bound. The glPrioritizeTextures function ignores attempts to prioritize texture 0, or any texture name that does not correspond to an existing texture. None of the functions named by the textures parameter need to be bound to a texture target. If a texture is currently bound, you can also use the glTexParameter function to set its priority.

For example, you cannot save the select or feedback states on the client-attribute stack. The depth of the client-attribute stack is at least 16. The glPushclientAttrib and glPopClientAttrib functions are not compiled into display lists, but are executed immediately. The glPushClientAttrib and glPopClientAttrib functions can only push and pop pixel storage modes and vertex array client states. You must use glPushAttrib and glPopAttrib to push and pop states that are kept on the server.

    "remarks": "The glReadPixels function returns pixel data from the framebuffer, starting with the pixel whose lower-left corner is at location (x, y), into client memory starting at location pixels. Several parameters control the processing of the pixel data before it is placed into client memory. These parameters are set with three commands: glPixelStore, glPixelTransfer, and glPixelMap. This topic describes the effects on glReadPixels of most, but not all of the parameters specified by these three commands. The glReadPixels function returns values from each pixel with lower-left corner at (x + i, y + j) for 0 \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 i < width and 0 \u00e2\u0089\u00a4 j < height. This pixel is said to be the ith pixel in the jth row. Pixels are returned in row order from the lowest to the highest row, left to right in each row. The shift, scale, bias, and lookup factors described above are all specified by glPixelTransfer. The lookup table contents are specified by glPixelMap. The final step involves converting the indexes or components to the proper format, as specified by type. If format is GL_COLOR_INDEX or GL_STENCIL_INDEX and type is not GL_FLOAT, each index is masked with the mask value given in the following table. If type is GL_FLOAT, then each integer index is converted to single-precision floating-point format. If format is GL_RED, GL_GREEN, GL_BLUE, GL_ALPHA, GL_RGB, GL_RGBA, GL_BGR_EXT, GL_BGRA_EXT, GL_LUMINANCE, or GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA and type is not GL_FLOAT, each component is multiplied by the multiplier shown in the preceding table. If type is GL_FLOAT, then each component is passed as is (or converted to the client's single-precision floating-point format if it is different from the one used by OpenGL). Return values are placed in memory as follows. If format is GL_COLOR_INDEX, GL_STENCIL_INDEX, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT, GL_RED, GL_GREEN, GL_BLUE, GL_ALPHA, or GL_LUMINANCE, a single value is returned and the data for the ith pixel in the jth row is placed in location (j )width + i. GL_RGB and GL_BGR_EXT return three values, GL_RGBA and GL_BGRA_EXT return four values, and GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA returns two values for each pixel, with all values corresponding to a single pixel occupying contiguous space in pixels. Storage parameters set by glPixelStore, such as GL_PACK_SWAP_BYTES and GL_PACK_LSB_FIRST, affect the way that data is written into memory. See glPixelStore for a description.

If RGBA color components are stored in the color buffers, they are read from the color buffer selected by glReadBuffer. Each color component is converted to floating point such that zero intensity maps to 0.0 and full intensity maps to 1.0. Each component is then multiplied by GL_c_SCALE and added to GL_c_BIAS, where c is GL_RED, GL_GREEN, GL_BLUE, and GL_ALPHA. Each component is clamped to the range [0,1]. Finally, if GL_MAP_COLOR is GL_TRUE, each color component c is replaced by its mapping in the table GL_PIXEL_MAP_c_TO_c, where c again is GL_RED, GL_GREEN, GL_BLUE, and GL_ALPHA. Each component is scaled to the size of its corresponding table before the lookup is performed. Finally, unneeded data is discarded. For example, GL_RED discards the green, blue, and alpha components, while GL_RGB discards only the alpha component. GL_LUMINANCE computes a single component value as the sum of the red, green, and blue components, and GL_LUMINANCE_ALPHA does the same, while keeping alpha as a second value."

    "remarks": "The glSelectBuffer function has two parameters: buffer is a pointer to an array of unsigned integers, and size indicates the size of the array. The buffer parameter returns values from the name stack (see glInitNames, glLoadName, glPushName) when the rendering mode is GL_SELECT (see glRenderMode). The glSelectBuffer function must be issued before selection mode is enabled, and it must not be issued while the rendering mode is GL_SELECT. Selection is used by a programmer to determine which primitives are drawn into some region of a window. The region is defined by the current modelview and perspective matrices. In selection mode, no pixel fragments are produced from rasterization. Instead, if a primitive intersects the clip volume defined by the viewing frustum and the user-defined clipping planes, this primitive causes a selection hit. (With polygons, no hit occurs if the polygon is culled.) When a change is made to the name stack, or when glRenderMode is called, a hit record is copied to buffer if any hits have occurred since the last such event (either a name stack change or a glRenderMode call). The hit record consists of the number of names in the name stack at the time of the event; followed by the minimum and maximum depth values of all vertices that hit since the previous event; followed by the name stack contents, bottom name first. Returned depth values are mapped such that the largest unsigned integer value corresponds to window coordinate depth 1.0, and zero corresponds to window coordinate depth 0.0. An internal index into buffer is reset to zero whenever selection mode is entered. Each time a hit record is copied into buffer, the index is incremented to point to the cell just past the end of the block of namesthat is, to the next available cell. If the hit record is larger than the number of remaining locations in buffer, as much data as can fit is copied, and the overflow flag is set. If the name stack is empty when a hit record is copied, that record consists of zero followed by the minimum and maximum depth values. Selection mode is exited by calling glRenderMode with an argument other than GL_SELECT. Whenever glRenderMode is called while the render mode is GL_SELECT, it returns the number of hit records copied to buffer, resets the overflow flag and the selection buffer pointer, and initializes the name stack to be empty. If the overflow bit was set when glRenderMode was called, a negative hit record count is returned. The contents of buffer are undefined until glRenderMode is called with an argument other than GL_SELECT. The glBegin/glEnd primitives and calls to glRasterPos can result in hits.

Smooth shading, the default, causes the computed colors of vertices to be interpolated as the primitive is rasterized, typically assigning different colors to each resulting pixel fragment. Flat shading selects the computed color of just one vertex and assigns it to all the pixel fragments generated by rasterizing a single primitive. In either case, the computed color of a vertex is the result of lighting, if lighting is enabled, or it is the current color at the time the vertex was specified, if lighting is disabled. Flat and smooth shading are indistinguishable for points. Counting vertices and primitives from one, starting when glBegin is issued, each flat-shaded line segment i is given the computed color of vertex i + 1, its second vertex. Counting similarly from one, each flat-shaded polygon is given the computed color of the vertex listed in the following table. This is the last vertex to specify the polygon in all cases except single polygons, where the first vertex specifies the flat-shaded color.  Flat and smooth shading are specified by glShadeModel with mode set to GL_FLAT and GL_SMOOTH, respectively.

You draw into the stencil planes using OpenGL drawing primitives, then render geometry and images, using the stencil planes to mask out portions of the screen. Stenciling is typically used in multipass rendering algorithms to achieve special effects, such as decals, outlining, and constructive solid geometry rendering. The stencil test conditionally eliminates a pixel based on the outcome of a comparison between the reference value and the value in the stencil buffer. The test is enabled by glEnable and glDisable with argument GL_STENCIL_TEST. Actions taken based on the outcome of the stencil test are specified with glStencilOp. The func parameter is a symbolic constant that determines the stencil comparison function. It accepts one of the eight values shown above. The ref parameter is an integer reference value that is used in the stencil comparison. It is clamped to the range [0, 2\u00e2\u0081\u00bf 1], where n is the number of bitplanes in the stencil buffer. The mask parameter is bitwise ANDed with both the reference value and the stored stencil value, with the ANDed values participating in the comparison. If stencil represents the value stored in the corresponding stencil buffer location, the preceding list shows the effect of each comparison function that can be specified by func. Only if the comparison succeeds is the pixel passed through to the next stage in the rasterization process (see glStencilOp).
