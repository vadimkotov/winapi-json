SM_SECURE 44   This system metric should be ignored; it always returns 0.   SM_SERVERR2 89   The build number if the system is Windows Server 2003 R2; otherwise, 0.   SM_SHOWSOUNDS 70   Nonzero if the user requires an application to present information visually in situations          where it would otherwise present the information only in audible form; otherwise, 0.   SM_SHUTTINGDOWN 0x2000   Nonzero if the current session is shutting down; otherwise, 0.          Windows 2000:  This value is not supported.

SM_SWAPBUTTON 23   Nonzero if the meanings of the left and right mouse buttons are swapped; otherwise, 0.   SM_SYSTEMDOCKED  0x2004   Reflects the state of the docking mode, 0 for Undocked Mode and non-zero otherwise. When this system metric changes, the system sends a broadcast message via WM_SETTINGCHANGE with \"SystemDockMode\" in the LPARAM.    SM_TABLETPC 86   Nonzero if the current operating system is the Windows XP Tablet PC edition or if the current operating system is Windows Vista or Windows 7 and the Tablet PC Input service is started; otherwise, 0. The SM_DIGITIZER setting indicates the type of digitizer input supported by a device running Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2. For more information, see Remarks.    SM_XVIRTUALSCREEN 76   The coordinates for the left side of the virtual screen. The virtual screen is the bounding         rectangle of all display monitors.

    "remarks": "If the mouse has moved, indicated by MOUSEEVENTF_MOVE being set,  \t\t\t\tdx and  \t\t\t\tdy hold information about that motion. The information is specified as absolute or relative integer values. If MOUSEEVENTF_ABSOLUTE value is specified,  \t\t\t\tdx and  \t\t\t\tdy contain normalized absolute coordinates between 0 and 65,535. The event procedure maps these coordinates onto the display surface. Coordinate (0,0) maps onto the upper-left corner of the display surface, (65535,65535) maps onto the lower-right corner. If the MOUSEEVENTF_ABSOLUTE value is not specified,  \t\t\t\tdx and  \t\t\t\tdy specify relative motions from when the last mouse event was generated (the last reported position). Positive values mean the mouse moved right (or down); negative values mean the mouse moved left (or up). Relative mouse motion is subject to the settings for mouse speed and acceleration level. An end user sets these values using the Mouse application in Control Panel. An application obtains and sets these values with the SystemParametersInfo function. The system applies two tests to the specified relative mouse motion when applying acceleration. If the specified distance along either the x or y axis is greater than the first mouse threshold value, and the mouse acceleration level is not zero, the operating system doubles the distance. If the specified distance along either the x- or y-axis is greater than the second mouse threshold value, and the mouse acceleration level is equal to two, the operating system doubles the distance that resulted from applying the first threshold test. It is thus possible for the operating system to multiply relatively-specified mouse motion along the x- or y-axis by up to four times. Once acceleration has been applied, the system scales the resultant value by the desired mouse speed. Mouse speed can range from 1 (slowest) to 20 (fastest) and represents how much the pointer moves based on the distance the mouse moves. The default value is 10, which results in no additional modification to the mouse motion. The mouse_event function is used to synthesize mouse events by applications that need to do so. It is also used by applications that need to obtain more information from the mouse than its position and button state. For example, if a tablet manufacturer wants to pass pen-based information to its own applications, it can write a DLL that communicates directly to the tablet hardware, obtains the extra information, and saves it in a queue. The DLL then calls mouse_event with the standard button and x/y position data, along with, in the dwExtraInfo parameter, some pointer or index to the queued extra information. When the application needs the extra information, it calls the DLL with the pointer or index stored in  \t\t\t\tdwExtraInfo, and the DLL returns the extra information. ",
